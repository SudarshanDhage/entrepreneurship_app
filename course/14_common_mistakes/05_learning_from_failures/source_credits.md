- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive collection of pitch decks and presentations from 50+ companies that failed, went bankrupt, or committed fraud. Categories include: (1) Startup failures - Astra Space ($2.1B valuation, down 99%), Byju's ($22B to $25M), Bird ($2B to bankruptcy), WeWork ($47B to bankruptcy), Convoy ($3.8B to shutdown), SmileDirectClub ($8.9B to bankruptcy), IRL ($1.2B with 95% fake users), Virgin Orbit ($3.7B to $36M asset sale). (2) Corporate fraud - FTX (crypto exchange collapse), Theranos (blood testing fraud), Nikola (truck fraud), Wirecard (€1.9B missing), Fyre Festival (fraudulent event), Frank (fake customers to JPMorgan). (3) Financial institution failures - Silicon Valley Bank (interest rate crisis), Credit Suisse (scandals and risky bets), Signature Bank (crypto exposure, bank run). (4) Historical corporate failures - Enron ($60B bankruptcy), WorldCom (largest bankruptcy at time), Lehman Brothers (largest U.S. bankruptcy), Bear Stearns ($2/share rescue). (5) Retail failures - Toys "R" Us (debt load from LBO), Blockbuster (Netflix competition), Bed Bath & Beyond ($17B to bankruptcy). Key lessons: Beware of overpromising, fraud always gets exposed, market conditions matter, valuation isn't reality, SPACs increased risk, business model flaws are fatal, regulatory scrutiny is real, competition is unforgiving, debt can be fatal, trust is fragile. Many failures show pattern of high valuations via SPAC followed by rapid collapse, inability to deliver on promises, and fundamental business model issues.
