# Pitch Decks from Failed Companies

"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." - Leo Tolstoy, 1873

Achieving success in business is often a complex and challenging journey, marked by numerous hurdles. The path is uncertain, with a significant risk of failure. Entrepreneurs and business owners encounter a wide array of challenges in their efforts to create a profitable and lasting business.

Moreover, the business landscape is not insulated from unethical conduct, including outright fraud, which is not rare. Such actions can greatly diminish trust within the business community, impacting not only potential investors and partners but also customers who could be subject to fraudulent practices.

Here are pitch decks and presentations from those who did not make it—from startups that failed to achieve their vision, to companies that went bankrupt, to corporations involved in massive frauds.

## Startup Failures

### Astra Space

Astra Space went public in 2021 via SPAC transaction at a valuation of $2.1 billion. However, Astra has struggled to achieve its ambitious launch cadence goals and faced a series of setbacks, including a failed sideways launch in 2021. The company never achieved the bi-weekly launch cadence it had promised investors.

In March 2024, Astra announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement to be taken private by its CEO and CTO at a price 99% below its peak. Astra warned that if the deal to go private does not go through, the only alternative would be to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidate the company.

### Byju's

Byju's secured billions in funding and achieved a valuation that ranked it among the most valuable startups worldwide, but the company faced criticism for delayed financial reporting and for not being profitable over the years.

The cash-starved startup, which has been hunting for new funding for over a year, late January 2024 launched a rights issue, where it seeks to raise about $200 million. The rights issue resets the startup's valuation, once at $22 billion, to about $25 million.

Later in February 2024, a group of Byju's investors voted to remove the edtech group's founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran.

### Bird

Bird was the fastest startup ever to reach a "unicorn" valuation of over $1 billion. The company went public in late 2021 via a SPAC merger, with a valuation of approximately $2 billion. However, the business was hit hard by COVID-19 lockdowns, with its market cap crashing to approximately $70 million just 12 months later.

Since 2018, Bird has racked up more than $1.6 billion in net losses. In December 2023, Bird Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

### WeWork

WeWork rapidly expanded globally and was once one of the most valuable startups in the United States with valuation of c. $47 billion. However, its attempt to go public in 2019 brought intense scrutiny, revealing substantial losses, questionable corporate governance practices, and concerns about its long-term profitability. This scrutiny led to the resignation of co-founder Adam Neumann as CEO and a significant devaluation of the company.

In November 2023, WeWork filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

### Convoy

Despite raising substantial investment totaling $825.5 million and being valued at $3.8 billion just 18 months prior, in October 2023, Convoy unexpectedly ceased operations and laid off its staff, citing a freight recession and contraction in the capital markets as the main reasons for its downfall.

The company had attracted prominent investors, including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.

### SmileDirectClub

In September 2019, SmileDirectClub embarked on a public offering, entering the stock market with an approximate valuation of $8.9 billion. By September 2023, the company ceased its global operations and filed for bankruptcy.

### IRL (In Real Life)

IRL reached a market valuation of $1.2 billion as of June 2021, with total funding amounting to $197 million. However, in 2023, an investigation by the board of directors discovered that 95% of the reported twenty million accounts were automated bots, drastically reducing the actual user count to around one million. This revelation led to the decision to shut down IRL, with the app formally closing in June 2023.

### Virgin Orbit

On December 30, 2021, Virgin Orbit underwent a SPAC merger and became a publicly traded company at the NASDAQ stock exchange. At the SPAC merger Virgin Orbit was valued at $3.7 billion in equity. After a launch failure in January 2023 and an inability to secure additional financing, the company laid off 675 people, or approximately 85% of the staff and suspended operations in March 2023, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 22, 2023.

The company's remaining assets were sold off to various aerospace companies for a total of $36 million, less than 1% of the company's valuation upon IPO.

## Corporate Fraud and Scandals

### FTX

FTX was one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It collapsed in November 2022 and filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. The collapse was triggered by a news report that revealed that Alameda Research, the quantitative trading firm behind FTX, had been manipulating the crypto market by using fake trades and bots.

### Theranos

Theranos claimed to have developed a revolutionary blood testing device that could perform hundreds of tests with a single drop of blood. The company was founded in 2003 by Elizabeth Holmes, who was hailed as a visionary and a billionaire by the media and investors.

However, Theranos was exposed as a massive fraud in 2015, when it was revealed that its device was unreliable, inaccurate, and often used conventional blood testing machines from other companies. The company dissolved in 2018, and Holmes was convicted of four counts of fraud and four counts of conspiracy in 2022.

### Nikola

Nikola went public on June 4, 2020, at one point becoming the most valuable car stock in the world by market cap. Nikola has faced several challenges and controversies, such as accusations of fraud, delays in production, partnership disputes, and executive departures. In September 2020, Trevor Milton resigned as executive chairman amid allegations of misleading investors and making false claims about the company's technology.

### Wirecard

Wirecard was a German payment processor that became part of the DAX index. It had over 5,000 employees and 300,000 customers in 200 countries by 2019. However, Wirecard was involved in a massive accounting fraud that led to its insolvency in 2020. The company admitted that €1.9 billion of its cash was missing and could not be traced.

### Fyre Festival

Fyre Festival was a fraudulent luxury music festival that was supposed to take place in the Bahamas in April and May 2017. The festival promised a glamorous experience with top musical acts, gourmet food, luxury villas, and yachts. However, the festival turned out to be a complete disaster, as the organizers failed to deliver on any of their promises.

McFarland was arrested and convicted of fraud and sentenced to six years in prison.

### Frank

Frank was a software startup that claimed to help students get the most out of the student loan process. Frank was acquired by JPMorgan Chase in September 2021 for $175 million. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase sued Frank and its founder Charlie Javice for fraud, accusing them of inventing millions of fake customers to boost their value and lying about their scale and success. In April 2023, Javice was charged by the Department of Justice with defrauding JPMorgan Chase.

## Financial Institution Failures

### Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)

Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in the United States, with assets of about $209 billion in December 2022. The bank was particularly well-known for serving startups and venture-backed firms.

In March 2023 SVB was shut down after its investments greatly decreased in value (mostly due to rapid increase of interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank) and its depositors withdrew large amounts of money. Later in March, First Citizens Bank bought up all deposits and loans of the failed bank.

### Credit Suisse

Credit Suisse was a leading global financial services company founded in 1856. It had over 50,000 employees and 1.3 trillion Swiss francs in assets under management by 2022. However, Credit Suisse collapsed in March 2023 after suffering huge losses from its involvement in several scandals and risky bets. Credit Suisse filed for bankruptcy in March 2023 and was bought by rival UBS for 3 billion CHF (about $3.3 billion USD).

### Signature Bank

Signature Bank had total assets of $110.4 billion and deposits of $82.6 billion at the end of 2022. By 2021, cryptocurrency businesses had represented 30 percent of its deposits. Banking officials in the state of New York closed the bank on March 12, 2023, two days after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. After SVB failed and in light of the closure of the cryptocurrency-friendly Silvergate Bank earlier in the week, nervous customers withdrew more than $10 billion in deposits. It was the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history.

## Historical Corporate Failures

### Enron

The Enron scandal was an accounting scandal involving Enron Corporation, an American energy company. Upon being publicized in October 2001, the company declared bankruptcy. The scandal involved Enron's executives employing accounting practices that falsely inflated the company's revenues and profits, while hiding its debts and losses. The scandal resulted in one of the biggest bankruptcy filings in the history of the United States, with more than $60 billion in assets.

### WorldCom

WorldCom was the USA's second-largest long-distance telephone company. From 1999 to 2002, senior executives at WorldCom led by founder and CEO Bernard Ebbers orchestrated a scheme to inflate earnings by improperly recording $3.8 billion in expenses as capital expenditures. The fraud was uncovered by an internal audit and resulted in WorldCom filing for bankruptcy in July 2002, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at the time.

### Lehman Brothers

Lehman Brothers was one of the largest investment banks in the world, with about 25,000 employees. However, Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 after filing for bankruptcy, becoming the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The main cause of its failure was its heavy involvement in the subprime mortgage market, which exposed it to huge losses when the housing bubble burst and the financial crisis began.

### Bear Stearns

Bear Stearns collapsed in 2008 as part of the global financial crisis. The main cause of its failure was its heavy exposure to the subprime mortgage market, which led to huge losses and liquidity problems. It was rescued by a government-backed sale to JPMorgan Chase at the shockingly low price of $2 per share, down from $170 a year earlier.

## Retail Failures

### Toys "R" Us

Toys "R" Us was established in 1957 and capitalized on the baby boom making Toys 'R' Us a retail juggernaut. However, the rise of mass merchants and online retailers cost Toys "R" Us its share of the toy market. The company was further hampered after 2005 by a significant debt load, the result of a leveraged buyout organized by private equity firms. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and 2018, closing all of its US, British, and Australian locations.

### Blockbuster Video

Blockbuster Video was once the largest movie and game retailer in the world. However, it began to decline in the early 2000s due to competition from online streaming services such as Netflix, as well as poor management by activist investors. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and closed all of its stores in 2014.

### Bed Bath & Beyond

Bed Bath & Beyond achieved a market value of approximately $17 billion in 2013. However, the company faced several challenges such as increased online competition, shifting consumer tastes, lack of innovation, inefficient capital allocation and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2023 and announced its intention to liquidate its assets and close its stores.

## Key Lessons

These pitch decks from failed companies offer several critical lessons:

1. **Beware of overpromising** - Many of these companies made ambitious promises they couldn't deliver (Astra's bi-weekly launches, IRL's fake user base)

2. **Fraud always gets exposed** - Companies built on lies (Theranos, FTX, Frank, Wirecard) eventually collapse

3. **Market conditions matter** - External factors like COVID-19, interest rate changes, or market recessions can destroy even well-funded companies

4. **Valuation isn't reality** - Many of these companies were valued in the billions but couldn't sustain operations (Byju's: $22B to $25M, Virgin Orbit: $3.7B to $36M)

5. **SPACs increased risk** - Many failures were companies that went public via SPAC (Astra, Bird, WeWork, SmileDirectClub, Virgin Orbit)

6. **Beware of business model flaws** - Companies with fundamentally broken economics (MoviePass, WeWork) can't survive despite funding

7. **Regulatory scrutiny is real** - Companies that push boundaries or violate regulations (Silvergate, crypto companies) face consequences

8. **Competition is unforgiving** - Established companies (Blockbuster, Toys "R" Us, Bed Bath & Beyond) can be disrupted and fail

9. **Debt can be fatal** - High debt loads made companies vulnerable (Toys "R" Us, Bed Bath & Beyond)

10. **Trust is fragile** - Once trust is broken (Theranos, FTX, Wirecard), recovery is nearly impossible
