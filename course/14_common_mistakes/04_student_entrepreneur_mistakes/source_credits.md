- **Context:** Based on 80 events and nearly 5000 attendees across France. THE QUEST startups have gone from 0 to 22M€ cumulative ARR in 4 years.
- **Key Concepts:** Startup definition, junk markets, starting fast, pirate mindset, intensity, co-founders, true fans, customer revenue, mentors/incubators, startup readiness
- **Key Insight:** The 10 most common mistakes: (1) Not really getting what a startup is - must be profitable, repeatable, scalable (PRODUCT not service, daily/weekly customer growth). (2) Focusing on junk markets - bad clients (few, rigid, long negotiations, small jackpot). (3) Why aren't you starting TODAY? - Speed of execution is only factor that works. Reduce timelines to 1 day/1 week goals. Examples: landing pages, crowdfunding, Wix/Wordpress + Typeform + Spreadsheet, print sign in front of nightclubs, newsletters, Slack/Discord, Photoshop mockups to sign contracts first. (4) Pirates are in rare supply - startups are acts of rebellion, don't partner with big corps, embrace hacker mindset, move fast & break things. (5) Put in more intensity - energy is #1 ally, surround yourself with people who've done it, startups are marathon of sprints, be missionary not mercenary. (6) Alter Ego vs Alter Zero - don't marry first person, find someone you'll be happy with for 20 years, someone you love. Start alone if needed. Communication is key - weekly/monthly dinners, talk about hard things. Even if you started first, bring great co-founder in for 50%. (7) True fans vs too good friends - 10 true fans > 100 unengaged users. Friends say "cool" which doesn't bode well. True fans talk about you to strangers, defend you. Get hands dirty, spend time, love them honestly. Lady Gaga example. (8) Good money vs bad donations - customer money is king. Only exception: technologically complicated products that take long to develop (Agricool example). 99% of cases: focus on customer revenue. (9) Do you really want to be mentored/incubated? - Old people will tell you it's impossible. Most incubators designed to make you stay and pay rent, not succeed. Be rebellious. (10) Is a startup really what you want? - If not ready to stop studies if project skyrockets, do "stuff" instead. Prepare: develop creativity, create network/friends, launch side projects, learn coding/selling. Value of little things underestimated.
