# The 10 Most Common Entrepreneurial Mistakes I've Seen Students Make

My name is Maxime Blondel (but you can call me Blondy). I'm the CEO of THE QUEST, an entrepreneurship program designed for the best 17–27yo tech builders. In 4 years, the startups created inside THE QUEST have gone from 0 to 22M€ cumulative ARR.

It's been 6 months since I started a School Tour across France: engineering schools, public universities, private business schools, digital campuses, high schools… With 80 events organized and nearly 5000 attendees, I've had the chance to interact with a lot of determined students.

And virtually every time, I'm struck by how that determination and enthusiasm wasn't being accompanied by a real economic & business education. At every event, I was pitched the same mobile apps or marketplace ideas… It started to give me a real sense of sadness, hearing the same mental/execution mistakes over and over.

That's why I decided to write this article of the most common mistakes I see. I really do hope that all those students starting a project out there will benefit from it.

## #1 — Not Really Getting What a Startup Is

Most of the students attracted by entrepreneurship want to launch a "startup", or at least that's what they say. The truth is, because of mainstream media and a lack of tech education, people now call almost anything and everything new a startup.

You're dreaming of starting your own restaurant? That's cool, go for it! But unless you include a breakthrough innovation in the business model (a robot cook?), it is not a startup. For example, back in the 1960s, Subway was a startup: it reinvented the restaurant real estate business model. Subway had a smaller kitchen than any other restaurant in the world, which meant more space to welcome more customers per hour, or lower rents for higher margins. That's what pushed people to copy them, and also what allowed them to implant Subway restaurants all over the world, becoming the model for restaurant franchises.

**So what is a startup, really?**

First and foremost, it is defined by a **profitable, repeatable & scalable business model:**

**Profitable** means you have to be able to make more money than you spend. It's not a problem if you're not profitable on day one. It took years for Amazon to become profitable. But you have to have a good idea of how you will get there.

**Repeatable** means you have to develop a product that could be launched in most places around the globe without being rebuilt from zero. For example, the Uber app is the same in San Francisco as it is in Paris. Google searches in Montreal just like in Porto. Facebook connects people in Sao Paolo and in London. Uber, Google & Facebook are products, not services, within which users are also part of the value creation process: ordering a driver by themselves, looking for information on their own, creating or sharing content with their friends…

**Scalable**, technically speaking, is seen within an economic structure in which the fixed company costs (rent, wages…) are at a certain level. Then, scalability is defined by decreasing variable costs over time, which means that, little by little, serving each new customer costs you less and less. Finally, scalability is defined by a growing revenue per customer over time, if all goes well. 

Not clear yet? Let's take a concrete example: you want to launch your own design agency. So basically you're selling human time & expertise. If it works well, you will need more and more employees to answer the growing demand from your customers, then you'll need a bigger office, and so on. So your design agency is not scalable: your fixed & variable costs will grow in proportion with one another, because you are a service company. 

On the opposite side, Google — which is a product, not a service — is maybe the most purely scalable business model in the world to date. At the beginning of its story, Google was losing money for each search query made by a user. Its server costs were too high and revenue was low or non-existent. After a few years, though, with the work of top DevOps engineers and an efficient automated ad agency, every new search query cost less money to Google than the previous one, while its revenue grew higher and higher.

See the difference now?

**PRODUCT (rather than service)**  
**DAILY/WEEKLY GROWTH OF CUSTOMERS/USERS (to reach this rare & sublime scalability)**

**Disclaimer:** Because a startup is searching for its business model and then for hyper-growth, keep in mind that building one is a very risky game. Risk is part of the startup DNA. Succeeding in inventing a new business model in an old and huge industry is not that common. Accelerating so much that you take over a continental or worldwide market in 10–20 years is similarly uncommon. And that's all without mentioning the luck factor and the unpredictability of the economy from a macro point of view. For all these reasons, there is no reason to build a startup except if you really are wanting to build an empire.

## #2 — Focusing on a Junk Market

"What do you think of my startup idea? How do I find a good one?"

Those are probably the 2 questions I've been asked the most during these past few months.

At The Family, we never judge ideas, it's too hard. But we have developed some knowledge & instincts regarding whether or not problems are real and the quality of different markets. Here are some insights:

Ask yourself: **Are my future clients good/bad ones? Do they have money? Are there a lot of them or do I think there will be a lot more of them over the coming years?** For example, I was recently told by 2 students that they want to "add blockchain in EdTech to certify diplomas". Even more than the too-many-buzzwords syndrome, I first told them that school administrations were bad clients: there are relatively few of them in the world, their processes are very rigid, negotiations take forever, and the jackpot to be won at the end is not that huge.

And second, I told them that the real problem of schools won't be solved by adding blockchain technology to certify diplomas (which is a reputation game), but in reinventing the way skills are taught, how programs are crafted, how bridges are built with the companies that recruit. You have to ask yourself: **Is my problem real, strong, and will it grow in the coming years in a way that warrants me putting all of my intensity into it?**

That being said, do not shy away from the fact that at the beginning startup ideas are always weird, simply because they are counterintuitive and so they seem unrealistic, even crazy. Just think about how a year ago, scooters were seen as uncool and old-fashioned. And QR codes used to only be used in bad advertisements in the subway. Today, Lime, Bird and Jump are everywhere in the streets! That's the kind of foresight you need to develop when it comes to judging whether or not you have a good startup idea.

But never forget that electric scooters (people transportation), Netflix (entertainment), and Airbnb (travel hosting) were funny ideas on big markets.

**So here are some more questions you can ask yourself to find interesting problems to solve or good markets that are open to startup ideas:**

- Ask yourself: What are my passions? Where do I have a network? Do I have resources or levers to exploit? In which sector would I like to evolve? Remember that if it all goes well, you are embarking on a project that will take up all of your time over the next 10+ years.

- Look at B2C trends and adapt them to the B2B market. For example, Slack was inspired by the rise of Facebook Messenger.

- Look for habits adopted by a minority or a specific community (example: wealthy people, freelancers traveling a lot, tech lovers…), and ask yourself if you can make it a commodity for the masses in the coming years. Look, did your parents ever imagine they could access a private driver in a nice sedan with the push of a button, at a low price? Uber 🙂

- Take a global success and create a strong brand that targets a very specific population. For example: Kard, black card for teenagers // Kymono, premium clothing for startups // Merci Handy, anti-bacterial gel for unicorn & rainbow lovers.

- Dream big! Trust yourself — if you've been telling yourself for years, "Imagine if we could reinvent the agricultural model and produce fruits & vegetables without pesticides, without GMOs, and have them be extremely tasty…" That's Agricool! The best way to predict the future is to build it.

- Find an old industry with a poor user experience and rework it to become amazing: it's Payfit! Remember: No conflict, no interest.

- Look at human vices if you want to create a consumer mobile app. It's sad, but when you look at all those that are really big hits, except games, they've all been built around that: Instagram ("My life is better than yours. Look at it"), Wish (compulsive buying / need to own), Snapchat (sexting).

- Look for the taboos and unspoken things of our society. Men have trouble talking about their erectile problems, even with their best friends? Now they have Charles. ❤

## #3 — Why Aren't You Starting TODAY?

Once you have found a problem that you are passionate about in what looks like a promising market, start as fast as possible. The best entrepreneurs I've seen have a real ability to reduce their timelines: at the beginning of the journey, set yourself goals that you can reach in just 1 day, or 1 week maximum.

I have seen too many young entrepreneurs theorize, make plans for what they'll do when, or write business plans for months before talking to any of their potential targets to learn from them, or confronting their idea with the market.

At The Family, among all the factors that we looked at (background of founders, number of founders…) for what defines the success or failure of startups, the only one we see that works is **the speed of decision-making and iterations: basically, how fast you execute.**

Trust me, at the beginning of your journey, you have always someone to meet, interview and/or convince as fast as possible.

**You want to create a physical product like FEMPO's ethical & chemical-free menstrual panties?** Start selling thanks to a landing page or a crowdfunding campaign while you meet factories and sewing workshops.

**You want to create the future of agriculture like Agricool?** Go convince investors because you will need a lot of money to execute your vision.

**You want to create a marketplace like StarOfService?** You can start by creating a showcase website via Wix/Wordpress, a smart request form via Typeform, a database via Spreadsheet, and make the connection by hand via email to start.

**A mobile application like Heetch?** Print a big sign and go post yourself in front of nightclubs to find customers to take back home while you're developing your app during the day.

**You want to create a new media company?** Start like My Little Paris, with a newsletter.

**You want to create a community?** Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups or live events will do the job as a Minimum Viable Product.

**You want to create the Uber of road transport and developing a first product will take you a lot of time without being sure that it will be perfect for your target?** Take a day and design a model in Photoshop of your software. Make an appointment with a potential client. Show them your model. Ask them for additional changes, enhancements & features that would instantly make them sign a contract with you. Sign the contract. Now you have 2 months left to develop the product and honor your contract. This technique also has the benefit of reducing your timelines. You will see that humans can produce in 2 months what we would have usually done in 6, so long as we have the sword hanging over our head. Hello Fretlink! That's "Fake it til you make it" ❤

**Long story short, the essence of entrepreneurship lies in execution, not theory.**

## #4 — Pirates Are in Rare Supply These Days

If you're launching a startup, you must see it is **an act of rebellion.** You're embarking on a legendary adventure, a Trojan horse that wants to enter the great fortress to burn it down and reinvent a new world.

**Stop wanting to partner with big corporations, you are a pirate!** Embrace the hacker mindset. As all those who have partnered with big corps will tell you, you don't want to be in that kind of relationship on a daily basis… Assume that you are there to overturn the cart, to move fast & break things, as the famous Facebook adage went.

Realize that our Internet generation has an economic & leadership opportunity never before seen in the history of the world: because the internet has made access to information free for all with Youtube or Coursera, because the internet allows everyone to distribute their voice, because executing is now a commodity with all the (almost) free tools available.

**You really can have a global impact from your room, without needing much in terms of resources or money.**

Need a concrete example? Take a look at the story of Oobah Butler, the most emblematic hacker of our generation, in my opinion.

## #5 — You Have to Put in More Intensity

I won't lie to you, it's going to be hard. Mentally and physically.

So:

1. **Energy will be your #1 ally.**

2. **Surround yourself with people who have already done it.**

At The Family, we see our job as similar to coaches of high level athletes. We bet on those who look like crazy ambitious people. We are looking for the golden nuggets, the hidden pirates, the black swans. And we make every effort to help them become Usain Bolt, Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams.

What we have learned is that **startups are a marathon made up of sprints.** Hard work over the long run will pay off. All the greats, even more than having rare physical and mental talents (and luck), worked intensely for years before winning it all.

For that, you need to be a missionary, not a mercenary. That's why all the tips in this article are related to each other: they all refer to intensity, passion & coherence.

**Beautiful stories only come from passionate people who work long and hard, because they had no option but to do what they were doing.**

## #6 — Alter Ego vs. Alter Zero

There is no rule in terms of who you work with. But it's in my opinion kind of like a wedding: **don't get married to the first person who comes along.** Or at least test how things go for a few months. Don't commit to someone just because you need their (rare) hard skill (👋 web developers). Skills can be learned, or you will be able to hire people in a few months if you have customers.

**Find someone you will be happy to share the journey with for the next 20 years. Find someone you admire for their soft skills, their behavior. Actually, find someone you simply love.**

Entrepreneurship is really a human game. Even if you are very good, there will be hard knocks and mountains to overcome. Doing it with and for someone you love will be much easier. You will give yourself many more chances to succeed.

How do you maintain this love in the long run? **Work on communication.** Go have dinner with your co-founder(s) every week/month. Get the good bottle of wine. Talk about the hard things, the things which are hard to hear but which if they are settled quickly, will bring immense value to your project and reinforce your relationship.

And what if you don't find anyone to join you? **Start alone.** If what you do is cool, you will find someone along the way: a friend of a friend at a party, a customer, a first employee who's becoming more than that, someone who has discovered you by chance…

Just don't wait.

**NB:** Oh and yes, even if you had the idea, started for 6 months and after 6 months you meet your great entrepreneurial love, don't be dumb, bring them in for 50%. It's all about trust and building something together.

## #7 — True Fans vs. Too Good Friends

At the beginning of your journey, it's better to have **10 true fans than 100 unengaged customers/users.** And keep in mind that your friends will play this role with great pleasure: they are your friends, they will tell you what you are doing is ''cool'', which is most of the time is a word that does not bode well.

**True fans:**
- Talk about you to their friends, family, at parties, while they didn't know you before…
- Defend you when you are attacked
- Create the strongest brands through unconditional love

Take a look at the FEMPO or Shanty Biscuits communities in the comments of their Instagram posts, you'll understand.

You wonder how you can achieve that? **You have to get your hands dirty, spend time with these people, understand them, create a strong relationship, really love them honestly, and do everything to solve their problem with the highest level of care in the service you provide to them.**

One good example of that is Lady Gaga's story. She created a strong iconographic universe (costumes) and a smart community identity ("My Little Monsters ❤"). At the beginning, she interacted on a daily basis with **ALL** her fans.

## #8 — Good Money vs. Bad Donations

Building a business plan to raise money before talking to your target customers and having charged your first ones, participating in shitty startup competitions where you have 1 chance out of 1000 to win €5000… I made those mistakes. I understand why first-time entrepreneurs do the same. It's pleasant. Going to talk to strangers and trying to sell them your product is much less so.

So let's be clear: **Money from customers is king.** It's the only way you will raise funds from good investors, if you want or need to raise funds. It's the only way you will survive and the only way for you to execute your vision.

There is only one situation where you have to focus on building an amazing product and not focusing on charging customers, and that's when you're building something technologically complicated, which takes a long time to develop. Agricool is an example, where it took time to develop an artificial paradise that copies nature, producing the first strawberries that could be sold to customers.

But in **99% of cases, focus on money from customers. That's it.**

## #9 — Do You Really Want to Be Mentored? Incubated!?

Yes, you want people to surround you. Your friends, your family, maybe advisors you really believe in. But if you're building something that disturbs the established landscape, you don't want a mentor (i.e., an old person) telling you what to do or not. **Old people don't live in the same world as you. They will tell you it's impossible. Please, be rebellious.**

With that in mind, some incubators are good. Some. But **most incubators are not designed to make you succeed, they are designed to make you stay and pay the rent.** Entrepreneurs are independent! Entrepreneurs are pirates! You have to feel and act like you're fighting for that independence, your ideas & your vision of the world.

## #10 — Is a Startup Really What You Want Right Now?

If you're not ready to stop your studies if your project skyrockets, that's ok, just do other entrepreneurial projects. Do "stuff". **Don't do a startup.**

At The Family, we never advise anyone to drop out. Why? Because if you're debating it in your head, it's already too late. You would have already done it if you really wanted to 😉 Dropping out is not for everyone. It's super risky, and it's always better in life to finish what we have started.

So, what can you do to prepare to launch your startup at the end of your studies? Many things.

- **Develop your creativity** by taking time to do things you love: painting, playing & composing music…
- **Create what is wrongly called a "network", i.e., friends.** For that, take part in sports clubs, student associations…
- **Launch side projects** like muses, passive income projects, … Try to set up an online business (dropshipping, marketplace, selling rare knowledge via video or PDF…). You will discover a lot of digital tools and you will better understand the economic process of distribution & exchange of value on a market.
- **Take time to learn new key things for the future:** learn the basics of coding if you don't already, learn to sell if you think you're bad at it…

People tend to underestimate the value of these little things, whereas these are often the foundations of rich and vibrant entrepreneurial destinies.
