# The 80% Rule

Chess Grandmaster Ben Finegold has a simple explanation for who wins amateur chess games:

**"Normally the game is very close, and then someone blunders and now it's over."**

Not strategy. Not memorizing opening lines. Not practicing end-game technique. **Just blundering.**

Jason Cohen analyzed hundreds of his own chess games. The player who committed more blunders lost 86% of the time. When including both mistakes and blunders, the player with the higher error score lost 81% of the time.

**To win at chess, blunder less.**

This pattern appears everywhere. Simon Ramo analyzed amateur tennis games and found that **80% of the points were lost rather than won.** Meaning, 80% of points were awarded because the other player made an error—hitting the ball out of bounds, into the net, double-faulting. Only 20% were "won" with powerful returns.

Ramo's conclusion: "If you choose to win at tennis—as opposed to having a good time—the strategy for winning is to avoid mistakes. The way to avoid mistakes is to be conservative and keep the ball in play, letting the other player have plenty of room in which to blunder his way to defeat."

**Could the same rule be true for startups?**

Amateur chess games: 80% determined by blundering.  
Amateur tennis points: 80% determined by blundering.

**Could "not blundering" be 80% of winning?**

Here's what we know: It's common to say "startups die because they ran out of money" or "startups die because the founders gave up." But that's like saying someone died because their heart stopped, without mentioning they were battling lung cancer.

**We need to identify the cancer, not just say "the founder stopped."**

The real question isn't what the proximate cause was. It's: **What blunders led to that point?**

Most startup failures aren't from bad strategy. They're from preventable blunders. Avoid those, and you're already 80% of the way there.
