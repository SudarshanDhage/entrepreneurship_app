# The Most Preventable Blunders

Here are the blunders that kill startups—and they're all preventable.

**Didn't talk to customers (and listen)**

If you didn't talk to customers before you started, and especially after you started, that's a blunder. If you talked to them and weren't honest with yourself about what they were saying, that's your faulty analysis.

**No market need / Bad market**

If the market was small and stagnant or shrinking, you already knew that. If there weren't enough people who needed the product, you could have known that. If they don't agree they have the problem, or that it's worth money to solve, you could have known that. The checklist of things that make for a good market is well-known.

Paul Graham: "There's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you make something users want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do."

**Did not select a target audience, and clearly communicate the value proposition to them**

Speaking to everyone means speaking to no one. It's laziness or fear of deciding who this product is for. You must sell to Carol, your ICP. Know exactly who Carol is.

**Too many things had to go right**

All startups have risks, but some have too many gaps—too many things to go right simultaneously. Your path should consist of "or's," not "and's."

**Founders / investors broke up**

You pick your co-founders. Either you've known them for a while (in which case you made a poor selection) or you didn't (in which case you made a rash decision). One reason "break up" kills startups is that the departing founder left holding a huge amount of stock—because there wasn't a vesting schedule for all founders. That is a blunder.

**Had no differentiation in the market**

This blunder is obvious from day one. You had no idea why you were special, why someone should buy from you instead of someone else. There are so many kinds of leverage you could have used, and you chose none of them.

Peter Thiel: "All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition."

**Refused to seek the truth / refused to see the truth / refused to learn**

We all have to force ourselves to see the truth, because the truth hurts. The truth is that our ideas weren't right, our insight isn't shared by customers, our awesome design is confusing. Did you even ask? If you asked, were you listening? If you haven't made major changes to your strategy and product and positioning, then you're blundering.

**Launching too early / Launching too late**

It's funny that both of these are causes of failure. It's a preventable blunder to launch with a crappy MVP instead of a simple but lovable v1. And because builders love only the building, they build for six months (or two years) without customers. Shipping crap, and never shipping, are both blunders.

**Premature scaling**

Before Product/Market Fit, the job is to discover what works. Scaling is about doubling-down on what works. Spending that time and money before you know what works means wasting all that time and money. A blunder possibly of ignorance, but typically of putting ego before the truth.

**Selling to the Enterprise before $20M ARR**

There are always individual teams inside large companies who will buy your stuff—that's good! But that's different from targeting "the enterprise." You probably don't even know what you don't know—a position of weakness that screams "bad strategy." Take the orders from the teams, stick with the leverage you have.

**Unworkable business model / cannot be profitable**

Unit economics can be measured right out of the gate. Mismatching price to the business model by an order of magnitude is preventable. Many companies say "we'll figure that out later," but that's just admitting you're blundering and hoping your future self will figure out how to stop blundering.

**Writing code instead of winning customers**

After you have a working product in market, why aren't you getting more customers? The builder says: Because I need more features. Or: Because the product has too many bugs. Both are incorrect. Coders like to code; everything else is hard, and not fun, and unclear how to execute. So people don't find you, and don't buy, and the company fails. You have to put down the compiler and talk to customers.

**Expanding the target market before winning the target market**

Someone on Twitter declaring that now that they've reached $2,700 in MRR, they are expanding into a new market segment. This simple blunder belies a lack of focus, a lack of conviction in the strategy, and lack of understanding that it is ten times easier to win another customer in your existing target market than it is to expand.

**Lack of passion / endurance**

This excuse is only valid if, on day one, you honestly took stock of what your passions were, what strengths you were going to leverage, had a mission you deeply cared about, read about the emotional whiplash that startups always entail, and made the trade-offs against other important things in your life. If you didn't do those things, it's a blunder, not self-discovery.
