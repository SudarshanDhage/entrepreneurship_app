# Strategy and Planning Mistakes

**Only planning for the most positive scenario:**

When it comes to startup success, luck and timing are everything. If the economy didn't tank, we might have been celebrating successful IPOs. Instead, companies have had to cut valuations by over 90% or lay off 25% of employees.

Yet, while luck and timing are critical, startup founders cannot plan exclusively for the most positive outcome. It's important to be prepared for different scenarios, since some factors such as the state of the economy are out of the company's control.

**The absence of a viable business model:**

Not every solution to an important problem can be a foundation upon which a successful company can be built. Moreover, not everything needs to be a business, and some initiatives are better off as non-commercial, accessible, free open-source projects.

Founders interested in creating a company need to be intentional when thinking about the business model, unit economics, revenue channels, cost structure, distribution, and other factors that impact business success. Just because someone is buying a product doesn't mean the company will be able to scale, if the unit economics don't make sense.

**Looking for consultants to craft the go-to-market strategy:**

Several founders hire consultants to "figure out the go-to-market." This is especially (but not exclusively) common when all founders are engineers who built a great solution and now they "just need someone to figure out who needs it."

Entrepreneurs are the ones who know their product, their market, and their vision the best, and their success is most aligned with the success of the company. In 99 cases out of 100, outsourcing the learning and crafting of go-to-market strategy to an external agency or consulting group does not work. If the founders can't understand who needs their product and close the deal, it's unlikely that someone else will.
