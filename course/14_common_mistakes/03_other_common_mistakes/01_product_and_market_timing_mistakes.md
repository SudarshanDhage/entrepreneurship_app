# Product and Market Timing Mistakes

**Trying to be a yet-another "single pane of glass":**

Being invisible in the enterprise stack doesn't sound as exciting as building "the only dashboard" that the practitioner will use daily. Most companies are driven by the desire to own the customer and eventually upsell them on new products, so industries are full of companies that want to be at the center of attention.

As a friend said once, "Most security products want to become a single pane of glass but instead they become a single glass of pain."

There cannot reasonably be 50 dashboards a practitioner must interact with daily. Therefore, trying to go to market as "yet another single dashboard" is not a winning strategy for many products.

**Building features in search for a product:**

Many solutions start as single features which then grow into products. Every feature wants to be a product, and every product wants to be a platform. While it's true that innovation is most commonly acquired, not built in-house, some solutions are way too granular to grow into something larger.

If a big vendor can build the same product in a month and a half, and the whole defensibility of the company relies on the hope that it won't, it's probably not the best problem to build a company around.

**Being too early or too late to the market:**

D'Arcy Coolican of a16z coined the term "product zeitgeist fit (PZF)" which he describes as a state "when a product resonates with the mood of the times." This is critical to understand.

Being too late to the market is bad—building an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution in 2023 is most likely a bad idea. At the same time, so is being too early to the market, when the approach is too futuristic and many years ahead of the time.

In many industries, there's a first entrant disadvantage because the company that champions a certain approach has to educate buyers about the problem. On the other hand, the first entrant can also enjoy enduring market leadership, if it can educate the market and execute well. Knowing whether the pros of championing the new approach are going to outweigh the cons is an art, not a science.
