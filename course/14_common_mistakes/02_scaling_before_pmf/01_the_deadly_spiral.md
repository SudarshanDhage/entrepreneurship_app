# The Deadly Spiral

The concept of product-market fit (PMF) has long been misunderstood, both in and outside of cybersecurity.

**Product-market fit is not a milestone or a point in time—it's a state.** Some companies mistakenly think that hitting $1 million of annual recurring revenue (ARR) means they've achieved PMF, but that could not be further from the truth.

If the startup has 3 customers that pay $400,000 each, that likely just means there are three companies on the market with some problem that this company is, hopefully, solving.

But if the company has 20 customers who happily pay for its product and renew their contracts year after year; these customers share some characteristic that makes them unique; and when the startup approaches other prospects with the same characteristic, a large percentage of them become paying customers—all this combined can be a strong sign of PMF.

**Product-market fit is not about a number. It's about repeatability.**

**A well-defined persona/market segment is critical** for the company to build a repeatable sales process. If a milkshake shop in Iowa, a large enterprise in New York, and a two-person law office in Delaware use the product, and there's nothing common among these three customers, the startup will find it hard to understand whom it should approach to increase the chances of closing the sale.

**Willingness to pay for the solution is easy to gauge:** The customer must either already be paying, or have signed a contract that obligates it to start paying in the near future in exchange for the value it receives. A prospect saying in a demo that "the product looks very powerful—we would definitely pay for something like that" is not the same as receiving actual money.

**When a venture-backed company has mastered founder-led sales and found the type of customer who is willing to pay for what it has to offer, then it's often the time to start scaling.**

Unfortunately, what we see much more often is that startups are raising a lot of capital, hiring large sales teams, and hoping that by doing so they can get to product-market fit quicker.

**This can create a deadly spiral:**

1. **Sales teams are given unreasonable quotas.** When they struggle to hit targets despite doing their best work, sales teams start channeling customer feedback that "we would probably buy if the product had X."

2. **Since founders become more removed from the sales process, the learning cycle necessary to get to PMF breaks** and gets replaced with the feature factory. The company starts building features customers ask for in the hope it will help with closing deals. However, since there's no well-defined customer persona and problem the customer is willing to pay to see solved, the company quickly loses focus.

3. **The loss of focus leads to the sales team trying to approach different types of prospects**, and since sales numbers aren't going up, more feature requests are sent to engineering teams.

4. **Since the company has hired sales teams, its burn rates increase**, and so does the pressure to deliver results. More pressure from investors to meet forecasted levels of growth means more marketing spend, more unfocused attempts to solve the problem of growth, and more building.

**This is a vicious cycle that traps many great founders eager to scale too quickly.**

To avoid potential problems, entrepreneurs should continue learning and iterating quickly to get to PMF before they start scaling the company. They must understand that just because they hired more salespeople, they won't automatically get more sales, especially if their positioning isn't working, there's no PMF, the product isn't meeting expectations around quality, etc.
