# Before Growth

**"We tell startups all the time that they have to grow quickly. That's true, and very good advice, but I think the current fashion of Silicon Valley startups has taken this to an unhealthy extreme—startups have a weekly growth goal before they really have any strong idea about what they want to build."** —Sam Altman

Growth is important, but there's a critical sequence that must come first.

## The Right Sequence

**In the first few weeks of a startup's life, the founders really need to figure out what they're doing and why. Then they need to build a product some users really love. Only after that they should focus on growth above all else.**

## The Problem with Premature Growth Goals

A startup that prematurely targets a growth goal often ends up making a nebulous product that some users sort of like and papering over this with 'growth hacking'. That sort of works—at least, it will fool investors for awhile until they start digging into retention numbers—but eventually the music stops.

Focusing on growth before you have a product users love creates several problems:

1. **Nebulous products** - You end up building something that some users "sort of like" rather than something they love
2. **Growth hacking as a crutch** - You rely on tricks to drive growth instead of building something inherently valuable
3. **Fooling investors temporarily** - Growth numbers might look good, but retention tells the real story
4. **Eventually the music stops** - The growth won't sustain without a product people truly love

## The Right Initial Metric

**I think the right initial metric is "do any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it?" Until that's a "yes", founders are generally better off focusing on this instead of a growth target.**

This is a binary test. Either users are spontaneously telling others about your product, or they're not. If they're not, you haven't built something people love yet, and no amount of growth hacking will fix that fundamental problem.

## What the Best Companies Do

The very best technology companies sometimes take awhile to figure out exactly what they're doing, but when they do, they usually pass that binary test before turning all their energy to growth. It's the critical ingredient for companies that do really well, and if you don't figure it out, no amount of growth hacking will make you into a great company.

**The pattern:**
1. Figure out what you're doing (takes time)
2. Build something some users really love
3. Pass the binary test: Do users spontaneously tell others?
4. **Only then** turn all energy to growth

## The Mission Connection

As a side note, startups that don't first figure out a product some users love also seem to rarely develop the sense of mission that the best companies have.

When you're focused on growth metrics from day one, you're optimizing for the wrong thing. You miss the opportunity to build something truly meaningful—something that creates a sense of mission and purpose beyond just growth numbers.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sequence matters.** Figure out what you're doing → Build something users love → Then focus on growth.

2. **The binary test.** Do any users love your product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it? Until that's a "yes", don't focus on growth targets.

3. **Growth hacking can't save a mediocre product.** It might fool investors temporarily, but retention numbers will reveal the truth. Eventually the music stops.

4. **The best companies take time to figure it out.** Don't rush the discovery phase. The very best technology companies sometimes take awhile to figure out exactly what they're doing.

5. **Building something users love creates mission.** Startups that focus on product love first develop the sense of mission that the best companies have.
