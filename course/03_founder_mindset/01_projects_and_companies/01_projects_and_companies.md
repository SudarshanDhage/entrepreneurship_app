# Projects and Companies

**"It's far better to be thought of—and to think of yourself—as a project than a company for as long as possible."** —Sam Altman

## The Shift in Perspective

In the early days of his startup, Sam Altman used to get slightly offended when people would refer to it as a "project." "How's your project going?" seemed like the asker didn't take them seriously, even though everything felt serious to them. He remembers assuming this would stop after they announced a $5 million Series A; it didn't. He kept feeling like they'd know they made it when people started referring to them as a company.

He now has the opposite belief.

## Why Companies Are Dangerous Too Early

**Companies sound serious.** When you start thinking of yourself as a company, you start acting like one. You worry more about pretend work involving things like lawyers, conferences, and finance stuff, and less about building product, because that's what people who run companies are supposed to do. This is, of course, the kiss of death for promising ideas.

Companies have high expectations—and the more money out of the gate and the more press, the worse off they are (think Color and Clinkle, for example).

**Worst of all, you won't work on slightly crazy ideas**—this is a company, not a hobby, and you need to do something that sounds like a good, respectable idea. There is a limit to what most people are willing to work on for something called a company that does not exist if it's just a project. The risk of seeming stupid when something is just a project is almost zero, and no one cares if you fail. So you're much more likely to work on something good, instead of derivative but plausible-sounding crap.

When you have a company, the clock is ticking and people expect results.

## Why Projects Are Better

**Projects have very low expectations, which is great.** Projects also usually mean less people and less money, so you get the good parts of both flexibility and focus.

When you're working on a project, you can experiment with ideas for a long time. You can try slightly crazy things without the pressure of being a "company."

**The danger with projects:** A lot of people use them as an excuse to not work very hard. If you don't have the self-discipline to work hard without external pressure, projects can be a license to slack off.

## The Magic Formula: Bad Ideas That Turn Out to Be Good

The best companies start out with ideas that don't sound very good. They start out as projects, and in fact sometimes they sound so inconsequential the founders wouldn't let themselves work on them if they had to defend them as a company.

**Examples:**

- **Google and Yahoo** started as grad students' projects
- **Facebook** was a project Zuckerberg built while he was a sophomore in college
- **Twitter** was a side project that started with a single engineer inside a company doing something totally different
- **Airbnb** was a side project to make some money to afford rent

They all became companies later.

All of these were ideas that seemed bad but turned out to be good, and **this is the magic formula for major success.** But in the rush to claim a company, they could have been lost. The pressure from external (and internal) expectations is constant and subtle, and it often kills the magic ideas.

**Great companies often start as projects.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stay a project for as long as possible.** Resist the urge to think of yourself as a "company" until you absolutely have to.

2. **Low expectations are an advantage.** Projects allow you to experiment and take risks that would seem unacceptable for a "company."

3. **Avoid premature seriousness.** Once you start acting like a company, you start doing company things—lawyers, conferences, finance—instead of building product.

4. **Embrace slightly crazy ideas.** The best companies started as projects with ideas that seemed bad or inconsequential. Projects let you work on ideas that wouldn't pass muster as a "company."

5. **Don't use projects as an excuse to slack off.** You still need discipline and hard work—projects aren't a license to be lazy, they're permission to be experimental.

6. **The magic formula:** Work on ideas that seem bad but turn out to be good. These are the ones that become great companies.
