# 20 Key Habits that Hold You Back

Successful people often have habits that worked well to get them where they are, but that now hold them back from reaching the next level. These are the 20 habits that Marshall Goldsmith most commonly finds in successful leaders.

## The Core Insight

**What got you here won't get you there.**

People who have read "What Got You Here Won't Get You There" often tell Marshall Goldsmith that they found themselves several times in the book. These habits are particularly common in successful people who are trying to become even more successful.

**The purpose:** To help successful leaders become even more successful by helping them stop these habits.

## The 20 Habits

### 1. Winning Too Much

**The need to win at all costs and in all situations** — when it matters, when it doesn't, and when it's totally beside the point.

### 2. Adding Value

**The overwhelming desire to add our two cents to every discussion.** Even when your input isn't needed or requested, you can't help but contribute.

### 3. Passing Judgment

**The need to rate others and impose our standards on them.** Constantly evaluating and judging others based on your own criteria.

### 4. Making Destructive Comments

**The needless sarcasms and cutting remarks** that we think make us sound sharp and witty. Often these comments undermine others and create unnecessary tension.

### 5. Starting with "No," "But," or "However"

**The overuse of these negative qualifiers** which secretly say to everyone, "I'm right. You're wrong." These words automatically negate what others have said before you've even heard them out.

### 6. Telling the World How Smart You Are

**The need to show people we're smarter than they think we are.** Constantly demonstrating your intelligence rather than letting your actions speak for themselves.

### 7. Speaking When Angry

**Using emotional volatility as a management tool.** Expressing anger as a way to make your point or get things done, rather than managing emotions constructively.

### 8. Negativity, or "Let Me Explain Why That Won't Work"

**The need to share our negative thoughts even when we weren't asked.** Automatically pointing out problems and obstacles rather than focusing on solutions.

### 9. Withholding Information

**The refusal to share information in order to maintain an advantage over others.** Keeping knowledge to yourself as a way to maintain power or control.

### 10. Failing to Give Proper Recognition

**The inability to praise and reward.** Not acknowledging others' contributions or taking the time to recognize good work.

### 11. Claiming Credit That We Don't Deserve

**The most annoying way to overestimate our contribution to any success.** Taking credit for work or ideas that weren't yours, or exaggerating your role in achievements.

### 12. Making Excuses

**The need to reposition our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture** so people excuse us for it. Instead of changing, we rationalize why we can't or shouldn't have to.

### 13. Clinging to the Past

**The need to deflect blame away from ourselves and onto events and people from our past;** a subset of blaming everyone else. Living in the past rather than focusing on the present and future.

### 14. Playing Favorites

**Failing to see that we are treating someone unfairly.** Showing preference for certain people and not recognizing when this creates inequity.

### 15. Refusing to Express Regret

**The inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we're wrong, or recognize how our actions affect others.** Being unwilling or unable to apologize or acknowledge mistakes.

### 16. Not Listening

**The most passive-aggressive form of disrespect for colleagues.** Being present but not actually hearing what others are saying, or making others feel unheard.

### 17. Failing to Express Gratitude

**The most basic form of bad manners.** Not saying thank you or showing appreciation for others' efforts and contributions.

### 18. Punishing the Messenger

**The misguided need to attack the innocent who are usually only trying to help us.** Shooting the messenger when you receive bad news, rather than addressing the actual problem.

### 19. Passing the Buck

**The need to blame everyone but ourselves.** Never taking responsibility and always finding someone else to hold accountable.

### 20. An Excessive Need to Be "Me"

**Exalting our faults as virtues simply because they're who we are.** Refusing to change problematic behaviors because "that's just who I am," rather than recognizing that growth requires change.

## Why These Habits Matter

These habits often develop because **they worked in earlier stages of your career.** Being competitive, adding value, showing intelligence, and being critical may have helped you stand out and get noticed. But as you move into leadership roles, these same behaviors can:

- Undermine team morale and collaboration
- Make others feel undervalued or dismissed
- Create a culture where people are afraid to speak up
- Prevent you from seeing better ideas and solutions
- Limit your ability to grow and adapt

**The key insight:** Success at one level often requires different behaviors than success at the next level. What got you here won't get you there.

## Self-Assessment

**Look at the list above** and honestly assess which habits you recognize in yourself. Most successful people will find several that resonate. The goal isn't to identify every single one, but to recognize the patterns that might be holding you back.

**The challenge:** These habits often feel like strengths or are so ingrained that we don't even notice them. They become part of our identity. But recognizing them is the first step toward change.
