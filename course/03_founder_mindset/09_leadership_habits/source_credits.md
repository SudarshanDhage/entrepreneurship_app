- **Key Insight:** 20 common habits that successful people have that worked well to get them where they are, but now hold them back from reaching the next level. Core insight: "What got you here won't get you there" - success at one level often requires different behaviors than success at the next level. These habits often feel like strengths or are so ingrained we don't notice them, but they can undermine team morale, make others feel undervalued, create cultures where people are afraid to speak up, prevent seeing better ideas/solutions, limit ability to grow/adapt. The 20 habits: (1) Winning too much - need to win at all costs in all situations, even when it doesn't matter. (2) Adding value - overwhelming desire to add two cents to every discussion, even when input not needed. (3) Passing judgment - need to rate others and impose standards on them. (4) Making destructive comments - needless sarcasms and cutting remarks we think make us sound sharp/witty, often undermine others. (5) Starting with "No," "But," or "However" - overuse of negative qualifiers that say "I'm right, you're wrong," automatically negate what others said. (6) Telling the world how smart you are - need to show people we're smarter than they think, constantly demonstrating intelligence rather than letting actions speak. (7) Speaking when angry - using emotional volatility as management tool, expressing anger to make point rather than managing emotions constructively. (8) Negativity, or "Let me explain why that won't work" - need to share negative thoughts even when not asked, automatically pointing out problems rather than solutions. (9) Withholding information - refusal to share information to maintain advantage over others, keeping knowledge to maintain power/control. (10) Failing to give proper recognition - inability to praise and reward, not acknowledging others' contributions. (11) Claiming credit that we don't deserve - most annoying way to overestimate contribution to success, taking credit for work/ideas that weren't yours. (12) Making excuses - need to reposition annoying behavior as permanent fixture so people excuse us, rationalizing why we can't/shouldn't have to change. (13) Clinging to the past - need to deflect blame onto events/people from past, subset of blaming everyone else, living in past rather than present/future. (14) Playing favorites - failing to see treating someone unfairly, showing preference for certain people without recognizing inequity. (15) Refusing to express regret - inability to take responsibility, admit wrong, recognize how actions affect others, unwilling/unable to apologize. (16) Not listening - most passive-aggressive form of disrespect, being present but not hearing, making others feel unheard. (17) Failing to express gratitude - most basic form of bad manners, not saying thank you or showing appreciation. (18) Punishing the messenger - misguided need to attack innocent who are trying to help, shooting messenger when receive bad news rather than addressing problem. (19) Passing the buck - need to blame everyone but ourselves, never taking responsibility, always finding someone else to hold accountable. (20) An excessive need to be "me" - exalting faults as virtues because "that's who we are," refusing to change problematic behaviors rather than recognizing growth requires change. Why these habits matter: They worked in earlier stages of career - being competitive, adding value, showing intelligence, being critical helped stand out. But as move into leadership, these behaviors can undermine team morale/collaboration, make others feel undervalued/dismissed, create cultures where people afraid to speak up, prevent seeing better ideas/solutions, limit ability to grow/adapt. Self-assessment: Look at list and honestly assess which habits you recognize in yourself. Most successful people find several. Goal isn't to identify every single one but recognize patterns holding you back. Challenge: Habits often feel like strengths or so ingrained we don't notice. They become part of identity. But recognizing them is first step toward change.
