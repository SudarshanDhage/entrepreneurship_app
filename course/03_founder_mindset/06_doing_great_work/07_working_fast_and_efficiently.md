# Working Fast and Efficiently

**Speed isn't just about meeting deadlines—it enables better work through iteration and experimentation.**

## Why Speed Matters

Designers often want time. Time to get inspired, think, explore, brainstorm, meditate, check dribbble, scroll a couple articles on medium but only look at the pictures and read the titles… you get it, it's all part of the creative process.

However, in the real world, more often than not you'll find yourself in a situation where you need to deliver something _yesterday_, and in such situations you just have to deliver.

Next to that lives the "fact" that, when you have a relaxed deadline you'll probably waste most of the time looking for "inspiration", leaving you in a position where you have to sprint to deliver something. **Basically, whether you have a tight deadline or you just want to procrastinate, being fast will only help.**

**But being fast is not only handy when you have to deal with tough deadlines, it can also help you stand out.**

As you might already know, designing is an iterative process, you try again and again until you get to the best solution. **If you're fast, you can try more things, understand what doesn't work, improve it and potentially you'll get to an even better solution.**

You can also go the extra mile and deliver more than what is expected, blowing away your client or boss. Moreover, when you do more you don't just improve your chances of coming up with something great, you also improve yourself, because practice does make perfect. **There's no such a thing as talent, you get good at something by doing it over and over, and the more you do it, the better you become at it.**

## 7 Tips to Work Faster

### 1. Define Your Goal

When you're in a rush it's tempting to jump into "design mode", however that approach might actually slow you down. **I rather take some time in the beginning to reflect and think what I want to accomplish before I start, because then, when I actually start I have a clear target.**

Not defining a goal is the same as if you go practice shooting with your eyes closed. You might hit something but it's way easier to do so if you can see your target.

This shouldn't take you ages though, don't use it as another excuse to not get started.

### 2. Don't Wait for Inspiration

**There's no such a thing as a "creative block", you might not be able to design great things all the time but you can design something, just get to it.**

If you're aiming for quality you might be waiting for that strike of genius to strike, and you think that is not wasting time because in the end it's all worth it, right? After all, quality is better than quantity, am-i-right? **NOPE, this is just a fallacy.**

While you're waiting for the muse to show up, someone else could have put down idea after idea, maybe not so great ideas in the beginning but through the power of iteration, this person can keep on improving, maybe a crappy idea then becomes something nice if you take just a slightly different angle and in the end they will have a better result than someone that was waiting for that one brilliant idea to show up, which might not even work in reality.

**This story/experiment from the book Art & Fear illustrates this point really nicely:** A teacher announced to his class that they were going to be divided in 2 groups, one would be evaluated solely based on quality, the other on quantity. When it came to evaluating the work, **the ones of highest quality came from the group that was going to be graded based on quantity.**

**This means that quantity leads to quality, so instead of waiting for the best idea to fall from the sky, 👏 JUST 👏 GET 👏 STARTED.**

### 3. Sketch, Sketch, SKETCH!

Independently of the problem I have to solve, I always like to start with sketching. **It's one of the most efficient ways to put abstract ideas into something tangible and see if they can work.**

It costs you very little time you're not invested or attached to these ideas yet, which makes it easier to throw them away if you need to.

It might sound counter productive, because if you want to be fast, "doodling" might sound like a step in between you and the final thing, but it's not, because you just don't know what the final thing is yet. **You're experimenting, so you better do it in a way that is fast and inexpensive.**

### 4. Share Your Progress

**I'm a firm believer that is best to share your work sooner rather than later.** You'll get other perspectives and you might just get the feedback that you need to take your idea to the next level.

You might also realise that your idea doesn't work or get a suggestion that means you have to throw away everything you did so far, if that's the case, you rather do it early in the process, when your investment was minimal and you're less attached to the work.

Another advantage of sharing the work is dividing the sense of ownership with others, for instance, if you're working in a team and you share your work with colleagues, when you go to a design critique it's more likely that they'll back you up, and help you sell the idea.

### 5. Listen

Sharing doesn't mean anything if you don't listen to the feedback that others will give you. **Make sure to listen what people have to say and then decide whether or not it's something that you need to take into account.**

When you're designing it's really easy to get lost on your ideas, it's also easy to discard ideas that come from people, that might have less expertise in the subject than you. However, **I believe it's important to remember that you're not designing for yourself, you're designing for others, so you can never rely solely on your own opinion.**

With that said, you're the expert, listening doesn't mean that you have to blindly execute whatever others suggest, it just means that you don't ignore it. **You take it to heart, you detatch your ego from your design and really try to see wether or not it makes sense to do something about it.**

### 6. Design in Stages

If you want to move fast, you can't spend time in details when you don't even know if the base idea works, you need focus on what is important. **That's why I like to break things in stages, so I can have check-points where I can share something and see if it makes sense to move to the next fase.**

These will very much depend on what you're trying to do, but here's a very loose guideline:

**Stage 1. The general idea** — This can be a very rough sketch that illustrates your logo; a couple wireframes that show an interaction flow; or some keyframes that show what the animation is going to be, as I said, it really depends on what is the task at hand, but usually the sketch is always a good starting point.

**Stage 2. Expanding the idea** — This is basically when you do a rough version of what your idea can become, but don't worry about details. Back to the previous examples, this can be your logo with a couple applications; a very rough prototype; or an animatic.

**Stage 3. Finalising** — This is when you're close to be done, and you start crafting your logo using proper grids and golden ratio; you make a higher fidelity prototype; or the final animation.

This won't just help you focus, it will also help others look at your work and give feedback adequate to the stage that it is in, for instance, you'll avoid getting comments about color when you're just trying to see if the general idea works.

**In short, it's never a good idea to do something from top to bottom and then share it, because you'll spend time on details, you'll get attached and you might realise that is was all for nothing.**

Optimise your time and focus on the right thing at the right moment.

### 7. Take Breaks

This is another one that might sound a bit odd, but **the moment you take a break and step back from the problem might just be the time where the solution occurs to you.**

This happens for the same reason why the best ideas come to you when you're in the shower or exercising, there's actually a proper scientific explanation for this but I'll just dive straight into my (dumb) version.

**The fact that you stop actively trying to solve a problem gives a break to your brain and you let it "run" in the background. Subconsciously, you're making a series of insightful connections and without even realising — DING— an idea pops in your head.**

This means that taking a break not only allows you to make some awkward conversation next to the coffee machine, it gives you energy and gives your brain time to digest things and to come up with new solutions.

## One Extra Tip: Time-Box Your Inspiration Search

My extra tip is to time-box your "search for inspiration" time.

Don't get me wrong, I believe it's super important to see how others solved a similar problem, because you don't need to reinvent the wheel with every design problem you have to solve. However, you most likely do this everyday, you know what is out there, you know the trends.

**So, set a time limit and after that GET GOING!**

## In Short

**Optimise your time, so you can invest in the right thing at the right time. Don't design in isolation, step away from your design and get other perspectives, this will only help you move faster, even if it sometimes means that you have to start from scratch. See the bright side, the sooner you realise that, the better.**

**The key insight:** Quantity leads to quality. The fastest way to get to a great solution is to iterate quickly through many ideas, not to wait for the perfect one to appear. Start with sketches, share early, listen to feedback, work in stages, and don't forget to take breaks. Speed enables better work through iteration, not despite it.
