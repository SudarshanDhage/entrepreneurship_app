# Choosing What to Work On

**The first step is to decide what to work on.**

The work you choose needs to have three qualities:
1. It has to be something you have a natural aptitude for
2. That you have a deep interest in
3. That offers scope to do great work

**In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion.** Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.

That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet.

**The way to figure out what to work on is by working.** If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

**Develop a habit of working on your own projects.** Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.

What should your projects be? **Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious.** As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics.

**But always preserve excitingness.**

There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.

**What are you excessively curious about—curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.**

The main reason it's hard to figure out what to work on is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. You may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it.

**What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on?**

What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow.

When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.

**So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious.** Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.

**When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.**

Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like.

But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.

**Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people.** The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before.

One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.

**But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty.** If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch.

**If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want.** The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use.

This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason this needs to be mentioned explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants.

And once you go down that route, you're lost.

There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds.

**But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.**

Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.

**But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning.**

In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.

**The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance.** You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.

For most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach "staying upwind."

This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.
