# The Mechanics of Work

Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward.

There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't like that.

**You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.** There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.

**While you must work hard, it's possible to work too hard.**

If you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.

**Ideally those hours will be contiguous.** To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.

**It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.**

You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project.

Since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.

**It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't.**

When Paul Graham is reluctant to start work in the morning, he often tricks himself by saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far." Five minutes later he's found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and he's off.

Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it be?"

This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.

**Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected.**

Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.

**Since there are two senses of starting work—per day and per project—there are also two forms of procrastination.**

**Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous.** You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done.

One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else.

So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.

**The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on?**

When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older.

**Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem.**

You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.

There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in.

**The reason we're surprised how far we've come is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work.**

Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year.

**That's the key: consistency.** People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

**If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth.**

Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.

The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.

Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started.

**Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to.**

There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.

You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions.

**Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle.**

When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead.
