# Originality and Overlooked Problems

**Great work requires originality.** And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new ideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers of knowledge.

In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity, and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name, because it does seem to some extent a separate skill.

**I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind.**

Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.

**I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have.**

For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult.

**Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas.**

When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.

**Changing your context can help.** If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.

**It also helps to travel in topic space.** You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.

**Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose.**

Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?

**When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably a good one.**

Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction?

It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious.

**One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people.**

Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage.

To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away.

**The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules.**

Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.

**Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it.**

So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad.

But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.

**People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve.**

Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.

**One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets.** A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days.

But even so most people are too conservative. They're not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued.

**One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't.**

Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential.

So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.

**But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does.**

How do you find these? By being self-indulgent—by letting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on "important" problems.

You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already on your subconscious radar screen.

**So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from "serious" work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do?**

The answer is probably more important than it seems.

**Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them.**

That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step—deciding what to work on—is in a sense the key to the whole game.

**Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.**

People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question.

Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles.

**But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.**

Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution—or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.

**Sometimes you carry a question for a long time.**

Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before—in your childhood, even—and couldn't stop thinking about.

People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive.

**Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered.**

Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement—of confusion!

You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.

**It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions.** And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.

Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.

**The best questions grow in the answering.** You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer.

So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.

**It's better to be promiscuously curious—to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens.**

Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger.

So start lots of small things.
