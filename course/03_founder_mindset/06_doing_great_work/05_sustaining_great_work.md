# Sustaining Great Work

**Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects.**

You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.

**Morale starts with your view of life.** You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.

Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life.

**Morale compounds via work:** high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work.

But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to.

Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you're stuck, just so you start to get something done.

**One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.**

You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.

Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right. It should be: **If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.**

"Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: **Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to.**

Corollary: Never abandon the root node.

**It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running.** It depends how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.

**An audience is a critical component of morale.**

If you're a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big. The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size.

Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.

**To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience.**

In some types of work this is inevitable, but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.

**The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale.**

You'll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it.

**If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while.**

It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-confidence.

If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested.

**Seek out the best colleagues.** There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.

**Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect you.** So work with people you want to become like, because you will.

Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not.

**How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues?**

In Paul Graham's experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't.

But here's an attempt at a more concrete answer: **sufficiently good colleagues offer surprising insights.** They can see and do things that you can't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.

**Ultimately morale is physical.** You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs.

Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they're good for thinking.

**People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't.**

In fact, if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous not to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to become bitter.

It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise.

**Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you.**

Don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder.

**Curiosity is the best guide.** Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

**Notice how often that word has come up.** If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on "curiosity."

That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it drive you.

Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them.

**The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.**
