# Writing to Think

**Writing is thinking. Writing is not the artifact of thinking, it's the actual thinking process.**

This is one of the lessons that every writer comes to appreciate: writing _is_ thinking. There's no shortage of great quotes on this topic, but the implications are less clear.

## Writing is the Planning Process and the Final Product

You don't design a final piece of writing the same way you might design a computer on paper. No writing emerges complete; everything has a starting point, and it's usually a really crummy first draft. (It might also appear as an interview, a note, etc.)

With other processes, there are different tools for preliminary work—many things start with pen and paper, but most things transition into either different software of some sort, or into the physical realm. If you're making a film, for example, you'd probably start off writing a screenplay, or drawing storyboards. After sketching out a design, say, you'll load up Figma.

By contrast, the materiality of writing is confusing because it starts and ends with ink on paper (or characters on a screen). Writing can start and end in Google Docs; this leads many people to think the writing process is an end point, and neglecting it as a starting point. It can be either!

## Writing a Crummy First Draft

If you only read books or polished articles, you might think that this is how all writing should _simply be_. If you'd started seeing people's first drafts, or journal entries, or notes, you'd realize it was completely the opposite; the writing only ended up like that after a ton of revisions. **A lot of writing starts off as wastewater.**

## Write for Fun, Even if It Makes You Look Stupid

Don't be afraid to write something that reads poorly thought out, entirely dumb, or completely whimsical. Writing is when you can allow your inner idiot to come out and play, to cause a ruckus, and to leave; your more critical self can then poke around and see what they left behind. As long as you're having fun and not hurting anyone, you're allowed to be as dumb as you like.

In fact, as you pursue your personal interest, you'll find that discovering your own personal inclinations and unconscious interests makes you luckier. "Chance IV is the kind of luck that develops during a probing action which has a distinctive personal flavor."

## Writing is Sketching

I've always loved the title of the book, _Why Architects Still Draw_; author Paolo Belardi makes the case that amidst more efficient, tech-driven, methods of putting plans together, drawing by hand is an integral part of the architect's working process. **The same goes for writing. Just put the words on the page; with enough words, something interesting will emerge.**

## Writing to Collaborate

If you practice articulating your thoughts on paper every day, you'll get better at putting what's on your mind into words that other people can then work together with you on. You can communicate concerns, possibilities, and action items, more clearly. You'll write faster, and better.

## Writing is Just Putting Words on a Page

It's really that simple, and that difficult. Have fun!

## The Practical Application

One commenter shared their experience:

> I bang out some sentences, even if they're lame (ie, "This program does stuff", if I'm writing about some code I want to write). Yet, those sentences get elaborated on (ie, "Some of that stuff has to do with xyz"). At some point, I'm stringing together sentences that just make sense. After a while, I've ended up with something that's very, very descriptive, and feels like it really express the nugget that it seems I was digging for in the first place.
>
> At that point the satisfaction comes from accurate expression, not how I measure up to the standards of other writers.

Another insight: **Writing really helps you slow your thinking down, and thus allows you to think more thoroughly, to go a level deeper than you would otherwise.**

## The Core Principle

Writing to think shares the same premise: Great ideas aren't found, they're made, through consistent creative practice. **Creative thinking comes from creative doing.**

Daily writing may not make you a better writer skill-wise in terms of deliberate practice, but it does help keep you practiced and lean, so that a creative block doesn't build up. It brings fulfillment and joy, and helps you put together more exciting and interesting ideas, and to think more clearly.

We don't control the results, only the effort we put into it.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Writing IS thinking** - It's not just recording thoughts, it's the actual process of thinking
2. **Start with crummy drafts** - All writing starts as wastewater; polished pieces come after revision
3. **Write for fun** - Allow your "inner idiot" to play; your critical self can refine later
4. **Writing is sketching** - Just put words on the page; something interesting will emerge
5. **It's for collaboration** - Clear writing enables better communication and teamwork
6. **It's simple but difficult** - Just putting words on a page, yet that's the challenge
7. **Slows thinking down** - Allows deeper, more thorough thought than mental processing alone
8. **Creative doing drives creative thinking** - Ideas are made through consistent practice
