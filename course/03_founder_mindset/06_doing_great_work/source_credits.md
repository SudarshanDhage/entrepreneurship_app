- **Key Insight:** "Perhaps 'great', is just 'good', but repeatable." Greatness is not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits. Greatness is not instantaneous—it's earned through a reflection of a period of effort. Two key principles: (1) Inputs are consistent over time; (2) Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs. The most sure way to success is through consistency, not being flashy. "If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times." Focus on consistently achieving small wins done in a good way, repeatably—not perfection. Life is a series of nodes with compounding and ups/downs. We quit at local minimums because we can't see the next peak. Hedonic treadmill makes down moments harder. Fall in love with boredom and the process. Acting with intention—learn what inputs deliver outputs. Best things in life are well-thought out approaches that are sustainable, not miracles. Great companies stand the test of time (Zoom vs. Juicero). "Moving fast and breaking things" needs a learning process. Habit of progression: become good at being decent. Create more nodes of optimization—test things every month/week, not every year. Ask: "If I were to continue this every day for the next year, would I be in a better place?" You can only ever see two steps out—can't fully conceptualize levels far ahead. Stop speculating—quantity group produces better photos than quality group because they take action. Instead of speculating greatness, get out there and start doing. Reframe: "How do I become good" not "How do I become great." In being consistent over time, you become the outlier.
