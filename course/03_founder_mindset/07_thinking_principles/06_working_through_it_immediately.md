# Working Through It Immediately

**Don't waste time talking about what you plan to think about; instead, work through it immediately.**

Intellectual laziness can easily sneak up on you. If you are sitting there talking about problems you plan to solve later, there's a good chance you are being inefficient.

Similarly, in GTD (Getting Things Done), you don't put off tasks that only take a couple minutes.

In many cases, you can outline and solve or at least clarify any decision or problem you're confronted with in just a few minutes.

**Don't schedule thinking. Think now.**

If you can solve it in five minutes, solve it in five minutes. Don't put it on a list. Don't talk about solving it later. Just do it.
