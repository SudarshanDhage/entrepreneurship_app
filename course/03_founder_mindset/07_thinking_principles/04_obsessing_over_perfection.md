# Obsessing Over Perfection

**If you are designing something that a customer is going to use or that will represent us in public, it's not good enough unless it's flawless and extraordinary.**

Especially in software, many situations have winner-take-all dynamics due to network effects and switching costs.

**Being the winner means being in the 99.99-percentile.** A winner at the top takes nearly everything, and only a pittance goes to the others—so being 99.99-percentile is worth an order of magnitude or two more than being just 98-percentile.

If it's 1am and you've already got something that is very good, this is why it's worth spending the next couple of hours to make it amazing.

**The gap between 98% and 99.99% isn't incremental. It's winner-take-all.**
