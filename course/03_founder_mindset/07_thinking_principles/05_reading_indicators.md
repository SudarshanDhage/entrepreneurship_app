# Reading Indicators

**Use small details as indicators to point to the larger truth—and be alert when they point to conclusions you don't like.**

Despite the danger in this approach—indicators are not always right—more often than not you can derive a lot of wisdom from subtle indicators.

How competent a single person is or how hard one person is working, or what a couple smart people think, might tell you a lot about a group before deciding whether to work with them.

**It's an important discipline to be open to any indicators that you find whether they confirm your biases or not.** In fact, you should be open to them especially when they do not confirm your biases.

Indicators can be about all sorts of things, such as about the importance of a contract, the effectiveness of our software in different scenarios, the opinions and biases of key decision makers, etc.

**Few people pay as close or as honest attention to them as they should.**

Pay attention to the details. They often reveal the truth that people won't say directly.
