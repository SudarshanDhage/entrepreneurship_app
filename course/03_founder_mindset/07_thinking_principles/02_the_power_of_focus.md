# The Power of Focus

**Don't divide your attention: focusing on one thing yields increasing returns for each unit of effort.**

At a micro level, an extra hour of focus on the current project has a much higher return than an hour on something new, or worse, 5 minutes each on 12 new things.

Before you ever do something new, you should understand the opportunity cost vs. existing things. Don't rationalize that something you want to do is complementary when it's not!

At a macro level, understanding that applied effort has a convex output curve is a very useful discipline when considering new market areas.

**This convexity means that the opportunity cost of transferring resources from existing projects to new ones is high.** Unless the new area is incredibly valuable, anything we can do to extend an existing convex curve is worth so much more.

**The lesson:** Focus compounds. Splitting attention destroys value.
