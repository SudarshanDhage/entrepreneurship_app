# Listening to Smart Disagreement

**Take the time to listen to smart people with whom you disagree.**

This is not easy to do. Over time, any firm will find that certain methods and biases tend to work very well, and the more successful it is, the more it will develop its own unique mindset.

We couldn't succeed without the methods and principles that we learn over time, nor can we constantly re-articulate why they are the correct approach to everyone who comes along.

A sort of pride rightly develops around the successful structure, but **this mindset cannot be allowed to ossify into an orthodoxy.**

So we have to use our judgment to seek out intelligent people who disagree with us—or even intelligent people who have simply taken a different approach—and be open about what we might learn from them.

Despite his very strongly developed and out-of-the-mainstream views, Peter does this constantly, and it makes him extremely effective.

**Don't surround yourself with yes-men. Find smart people who challenge your thinking.**
