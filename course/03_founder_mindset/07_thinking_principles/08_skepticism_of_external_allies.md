# Skepticism of External Allies

**Be skeptical of any sort of external allies, and don't trust the execution of anyone outside Palantir.**

In the abstract, this is because the incentives of the other company will not line up with ours, and even if they do for the moment, they no longer will once the situation changes.

In specific, other companies don't have the same culture of execution that Palantir does, and we don't have the power to instill that culture in them.

**Very early on, Peter saved Palantir from a partnership that would likely have destroyed the company.**

In practice, that skepticism has led us to force others to pay upfront as one of the ways of proving value, which has worked well.

**Ultimately, only our own execution can make us win.**

Don't depend on others to execute. If you can't control it, don't depend on it. If you can, make them prove value upfront.
