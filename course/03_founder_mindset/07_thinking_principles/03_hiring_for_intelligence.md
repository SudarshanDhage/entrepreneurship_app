# Hiring for Intelligence

**In hiring, value intelligence highly. Like focus, intelligence yields increasing returns.**

Like focus, intelligence has a convex output curve—the smartest people can be an order of magnitude more productive than others who are only somewhat less smart.

**The key in hiring is to value potential skill rather than currently existing skill—and potential skill is based on intelligence rather than training.**

Don't just hire for what someone can do today. Hire for what they can become.

Intelligence compounds. Someone who's smart will figure out what they don't know. Someone who's less smart might have the credentials, but they'll hit a ceiling.
