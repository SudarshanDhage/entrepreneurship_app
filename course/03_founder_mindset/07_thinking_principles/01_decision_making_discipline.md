# Decision-Making Discipline

**Divide reasoning into separate parts and clearly identify the most important factor.**

If there's no single reason that can cause you to do something, you should think carefully about whether it's important or not.

Oftentimes we'll want to do something, and we'll give multiple reasons for it without thinking hard about them. If you can't give a single reason that justifies doing something on its own, you should be very wary that you aren't exercising sufficient intellectual discipline.

**The test:** Can you give one reason that, by itself, justifies doing this?

If you need multiple reasons to justify something, that's a red flag. It suggests you're rationalizing rather than reasoning clearly.
