Everything is easier once you've reached a baseline of success, but much applies to anyone. Key principles include: (1) Compound yourself - be an exponential curve, not linear; (2) Have almost too much self-belief, balanced with self-awareness; (3) Learn to think independently; (4) Get good at "sales" - all great careers become sales jobs; (5) Make it easy to take risks - small bets with 1x downside, 100x upside; (6) Focus is a force multiplier; (7) Work hard - 90th percentile needs smart OR hard, 99th percentile needs both; (8) Be bold - easier to do hard startups than easy ones; (9) Be willful - bend the world to your will; (10) Be hard to compete with - build leverage; (11) Build a network - help people, be generous, discover talent; (12) You get rich by owning things, not selling time; (13) Be internally driven - work to impress yourself, not others.
