# Module: How To Be Successful

"I've observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter."

This module presents 13 principles for achieving outlier success, based on Sam Altman's observations of thousands of founders. Everything here is easier to do once you've already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. But much of it applies to anyone.
