# Climbing the Wrong Hill

**"People tend to systematically overvalue near term over long term rewards. This effect seems to be even stronger in more ambitious people. Their ambition seems to make it hard for them to forgo the nearby upward step."** —Chris Dixon

A brilliant young person graduates from college and works at a large investment bank. He decides he hates Wall Street and wants to work at a tech startup. He gives notice to his bosses, who respond by offering him a raise and greater responsibility if he stays. Joining the technology industry, he'd be starting from scratch. Despite having no long-term ambitions in finance, he's thinking of staying.

This is a common trap. Over the years, I've run into many prospective employees in similar situations. When I ask them: "What do you want to be doing in 10 years?" The answer is invariably "working at or founding a tech startup" – yet most of them decide to remain on their present path and not join a startup. Then, a few years later, they finally quit their job, but only after having spent years in an industry they didn't enjoy, and that didn't really advance them toward their long term ambitions.

## The Hill Climbing Problem

How can smart, ambitious people stay working in an area where they have no long term ambitions? A good analogy for the mistake they are making can be found in computer science.

**A classic problem in computer science is hill climbing.** Imagine you are dropped at a random spot on a hilly terrain, where you can only see a few feet in each direction (assume it's foggy). The goal is to get to the highest hill.

### The Simplest Algorithm

Consider the simplest algorithm. At any given moment, take a step in the direction that takes you higher. **The risk with this method is if you happen to start near the lower hill, you'll end up at the top of that lower hill, not the top of the tallest hill.**

### Better Algorithms

**A more sophisticated version** adds some randomness into your walk. You start out with lots of randomness and reduce the amount of randomness over time. This gives you a better chance of meandering near the bigger hill before you start your focused, non-random climb.

**Another and generally better algorithm** has you repeatedly drop yourself in random parts of the terrain, do simple hill climbing, and then after many such attempts step back and decide which of the hills were highest.

## The Human Problem

Going back to the job candidate, he has the benefit of having a less foggy view of his terrain. He knows (or at least believes) he wants to end up at the top of a different hill than he is presently climbing. He can see that higher hill from where he stands.

**But the lure of the current hill is strong.** There is a natural human tendency to make the next step an upward one. He ends up falling for a common trap highlighted by behavioral economists: **people tend to systematically overvalue near term over long term rewards.**

**This effect seems to be even stronger in more ambitious people.** Their ambition seems to make it hard for them to forgo the nearby upward step.

## The Solution

**People early in their career should learn from computer science:**

1. **Meander some in your walk (especially early on)** - Don't be too focused on the immediate upward step. Explore.

2. **Randomly drop yourself into new parts of the terrain** - Try different industries, roles, or paths. See what's out there.

3. **When you find the highest hill, don't waste any more time on the current hill** - No matter how much better the next step up might appear, if you know you want to be on a different hill, start moving toward it now.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The trap:** Smart, ambitious people often stay in careers they don't want because they can't resist the nearby upward step, even when they know their long-term goal is on a different hill.

2. **The behavioral economics insight:** People systematically overvalue near-term rewards over long-term rewards. This is even stronger in ambitious people.

3. **The question to ask yourself:** "What do you want to be doing in 10 years?" If your current path doesn't align, you're climbing the wrong hill.

4. **Early career strategy:** 
   - Meander and explore (especially early on)
   - Randomly drop yourself into new parts of the terrain
   - When you find the highest hill, don't waste time on the current one

5. **The cost of delay:** The longer you stay on the wrong hill, the more time you waste in an industry you don't enjoy that doesn't advance you toward your long-term ambitions.

6. **You can see the higher hill:** Unlike the foggy terrain of the algorithm, you often know where you want to be. Don't let the lure of the current hill's upward step distract you from moving toward where you actually want to go.
