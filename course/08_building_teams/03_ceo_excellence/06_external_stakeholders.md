# External Stakeholders: Center on the Long-Term 'Why?'

**Every CEO should know their company's mission and values.** Good CEOs know that these statements need to amount to more than slogans for office posters and use them to influence decision making and day-to-day behaviors.

**Excellent CEOs go further: they reinforce and act on a corporate purpose (the "Why?") that involves not just making money but also benefiting society.** This posture, along with a granular approach to prioritizing stakeholder interactions and a sound corporate resilience plan, lets CEOs minimize the company's exposure to customer- and stakeholder-related risks, and capitalize on new opportunities.

**Social purpose: Look at the big picture.**

Many corporate social responsibility programs are little more than public-relations exercises: collections of charitable initiatives that generate good feelings but have minimal lasting influence on society's well-being.

**Excellent CEOs spend time thinking about, articulating, and championing the purpose of their company as it relates to the big-picture impact of day-to-day business practices.** They push for meaningful efforts to create jobs, abide by ethical labor practices, improve customers' lives, and lessen the environmental harm caused by operations.

Visible results matter to stakeholders; for example, 87 percent of customers say that they will purchase from companies that support issues they care about, 94 percent of millennials say that they want to use their skills to benefit a cause, and sustainable investing has grown 18-fold since 1995.

**And not demonstrating such results isn't an option—wise CEOs know they will be held to account for fulfilling their promises.**

**Interactions: Prioritize and shape.**

Excellent CEOs systematically prioritize, proactively schedule, and use interactions with their companies' important external stakeholders to motivate action. CEOs of B2B companies typically focus on their highest-value and largest potential customers. CEOs of B2C companies often like to make unannounced visits to stores and other frontline operations to better understand the customer experience that the business provides.

They also spend time with their companies' 15 or 20 most important "intrinsic" investors (those who are most knowledgeable and engaged) and assign the rest to the CFO and the investor-relations department. Other stakeholder groups (such as regulators, politicians, advocacy groups, and community organizations) also will require a portion of the CEO's time.

**The efficacy of these interactions isn't left to chance.** Excellent CEOs know what they want to accomplish, prepare well, communicate audience-tailored messages (always centered on their company's "Why?"), listen intently, and seek win–win solutions where possible.

**Moments of truth: Build resilience ahead of a crisis.**

Good CEOs ensure that their companies have an effective risk operating model, governance structure, and risk culture. Great CEOs and their boards also anticipate major shocks, macroeconomic events, and other potential crises.

**There's good reason to do this:** headlines that carried the word "crisis" alongside the names of 100 top companies appeared 80 percent more often from 2010 to 2017 than they did in the previous decade.

Excellent CEOs recognize that most crises follow predictable patterns even though each one feels unique. With that in mind, they prepare a crisis-response playbook that sets out leadership roles, war-room configuration, resilience tests, action plans, and communications approaches. They seek opportunities to go on the offensive, to the extent they can. And they know that stakeholders' anger will likely center on them, in ways that can affect their family and friends, and accordingly develop a personal resilience plan.
