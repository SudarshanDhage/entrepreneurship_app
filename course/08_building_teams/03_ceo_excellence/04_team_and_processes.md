# Team and Processes: Put Dynamics Ahead of Mechanics

**The dynamics of a top team can strongly influence a company's success.** Yet more than half of senior executives report that the top team is underperforming.

The CEO is often out of touch with this reality: on average, less than one-third of CEOs report problems with their teams. The efficiency and effectiveness of a company's core management processes also can change a company's fortunes, yet less than a third of employees report that their company's management processes support the achievement of business objectives.

**Why the disconnect?** The problem is not an intellectual one, but a social one: individual and institutional biases and clunky group dynamics can diminish with the effectiveness of the team and its processes. Excellent CEOs acknowledge this reality and counteract it in several ways.

**Teamwork: Show resolve.**

**The best CEOs take special care to ensure their management team performs strongly as a unit.** The reward for doing so is real: top teams that work together toward a common vision are 1.9 times more likely to deliver above-median financial performance.

In practice, CEOs swiftly adjust the team's composition (size, diversity, and capability), which can involve hard calls on removing likeable low performers and disagreeable high performers and on elevating people with high potential. CEOs should also calibrate individual relationships, maintaining the distance to be objective but enough closeness to gain trust and loyalty.

Further, they commit to making the team productive by regularly taking stock of and improving its operating rhythm, meeting protocols, interaction quality, and dynamics. They also firmly prohibit members from putting their interests ahead of the company's needs, holding discussions that consist of "theater" rather than "substance," "having the meeting outside the room," backsliding on decisions, or showing disrespect for one another.

**Decision making: Defend against biases.**

Cognitive and organizational biases worsen everyone's judgment. Such biases contribute to many common performance shortfalls, such as the significant cost overruns that affect 90 percent of capital projects.

**We also know that biases cannot be unlearned.** Even behavioral economist Dan Ariely, one of the foremost authorities on cognitive biases, admits, "I was just as bad myself at making decisions as everyone else I write about."

Nevertheless, CEOs sometimes feel as though they're immune to bias (after all, they might ask, hasn't good judgment gotten them where they are?).

**Excellent CEOs endeavor to minimize the effect of biases by instituting such processes as:**
- Preemptively solving for failure modes (premortems)
- Formally appointing a contrarian (red team)
- Disregarding past information (clean sheet)
- Taking plan A off the table (vanishing options)

They also ensure they have a diverse team, which has been shown to improve decision-making quality.

**Management processes: Ensure coherence.**

The CEO typically delegates management processes to other executives: the CFO looks after budgeting and sometimes strategy as well; the CHRO looks after talent management and workforce planning; the CIO looks after technology investment; and so on.

**However, sensible individual processes can cohere into a clumsy system that results in more confusion and wasted effort than accountability and value.** Managers pushed to agree to stretch targets find at year's end that they are being held accountable for full delivery; sandbagging ensues. Long-term strategies are set, yet talent promotions are based on near-term results. Urgent product ideas are approved, only to get bogged down in long technology queues and one-size-fits-all risk-management processes.

**Excellent CEOs don't allow one management process to foil another.** They require executives to coordinate their decision making and resource assignments to ensure that management processes reinforce priorities and work together to propel execution and continual refinement of the strategy.

**Rules should serve the company, not the other way around.**

In general, always pick common sense as your guide. **If following a "company rule" is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation, such that it would make for a great Dilbert cartoon, then the rule should change.**

Processes and rules exist to help the company operate better. When they become an obstacle to getting things done, they've lost their purpose. Excellent CEOs recognize when rules have outlived their usefulness and empower their teams to challenge and change them.
