# Corporate Strategy: Focus on Beating the Odds

**It's incumbent on the leader to set the direction for the company—to have a plan in the face of uncertainty.**

One way that CEOs try to reduce strategic uncertainty is to focus on options with the firmest business cases. Research shows, however, that this approach delivers another sort of outcome: the dreaded "hockey stick" effect, consisting of a projected dip in next year's budget, followed by a promise of success, which never occurs.

**A more realistic approach recognizes that 10 percent of companies create 90 percent of the total economic profit** (profit after subtracting the cost of capital), and that only one in 12 companies moves from being an average performer to a top-quintile performer over a ten-year period.

The odds of making the jump from average to outstanding might be long, but CEOs can greatly increase the probability of beating those odds.

**Vision: Reframe what winning means.**

The CEO is the ultimate decision maker when it comes to setting a company's vision (where do we want to be in five, ten, or 15 years?). Good CEOs do this by considering their mandate and expectations, the relative strengths and purpose of their company, a clear understanding of what enables the business to generate value, opportunities and trends in the marketplace, and their personal aspirations and values.

**The best go one step further and reframe the reference point for success.** For example, instead of a manufacturer aspiring to be number one in the industry, the CEO can broaden the objective to be in the top quartile among all industrials. Such a reframing acknowledges that companies compete for talent, capital, and influence on a bigger stage than their industry.

**Strategy: Make bold moves early.**

According to McKinsey research, five bold strategic moves best correlate with success:
- Resource reallocation
- Programmatic mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures
- Capital expenditure
- Productivity improvements
- Differentiation improvements

**To move "boldly" is to shift at least 30 percent more than the industry median.** Making one or two bold moves more than doubles the likelihood of rising from the middle quintiles of economic profit to the top quintile, and making three or more bold moves makes such a rise six times more likely.

Furthermore, CEOs who make these moves earlier in their tenure outperform those who move later, and those who do so multiple times in their tenure avoid an otherwise common decline in performance.

**Not surprisingly, data also show that externally hired CEOs are more likely to move with boldness and speed than those promoted from within an organization.** CEOs who are promoted from internal roles should explicitly ask and answer the question, "What would an outsider do?" as they determine their strategic moves.

**Resource allocation: Stay active.**

Resource reallocation isn't just a bold strategic move on its own; it's also an essential enabler of the other strategic moves. Companies that reallocate more than 50 percent of their capital expenditures among business units over ten years create 50 percent more value than companies that reallocate more slowly.

**The benefit of this approach might seem obvious, yet a third of companies reallocate a mere 1 percent of their capital from year to year.** Furthermore, research using our CEO database found that the top decile of high performing CEOs are 35 percent more likely to dynamically reallocate capital than average performers.

To ensure that resources are swiftly reallocated to where they will deliver the most value rather than spread thinly across businesses and operations, excellent CEOs institute an ongoing (not annual) stage-gate process. Such a process takes a granular view, makes comparisons using quantitative metrics, prompts when to stop funding and when to continue it, and is backed by the CEO's personal resolve to continually optimize the company's allocation of resources.
