# How One CEO Spent His First Two Years

Sam Corcos tracked every 15-minute increment of how he spent his time as CEO of Levels for two years. Here's what the data revealed.

**People often wonder how startup CEOs spend their time.**

As a four-time founder, Sam Corcos had historically been on the technical side of companies. His role as CEO of Levels was his first non-technical role. So he decided to track everything—and what he found surprised him.

**The biggest surprise: how variable the role of a CEO is at different points in the company's history.**

What he spent his time on oscillated as the needs of the company changed. There were months when he took on meaningful engineering responsibilities, others where he was primarily a salesman, and others when he was taking lead on fundraising.

**Unblocking others is your top priority**

Regardless of whether you're focused on fundraising, selling, or product, as a CEO you're responsible for the output of the entire organization.

**If the company is a steam engine, my job is to be the lubricant — I don't have any real deliverables other than to make sure all the other parts are running smoothly.**

If the Engineering team is blocked by data integrity issues, or the Growth team is confused due to a lack of clear company strategy, or the Product team is being slowed down by a lack of process, it's your job to step in and support where needed.

**Takeaway #1:** You should primarily be an information router, and you need to make communication a top priority. Block off recurring blocks of time every day to process email. I need to process 3-4 hours of email every day in order to stay on top of communication, so adding these blocks to my calendar forces me to stay realistic about how much other work I can actually do in a given week.

**Don't treat communications as an afterthought. It's your main job.**

**Takeaway #2:** Make sure you keep bandwidth open and always seek to make yourself redundant. It's only during times when you have the available capacity that you can see where the gaps are in the company. If you're too focused on your own deliverables, you're at risk of missing the forest for the trees.

**Ditch your to-do list**

The most substantial improvement in Sam's ability to manage his time came from using his calendar as his to-do list (and subsequently killing his to-do list). Killing the to-do list also had the unintended consequence of substantially reducing his personal stress and anxiety—one of his biggest mental health wins of all time.

**The problem with to-do lists is they lead to unrealistic optimism about how much you can accomplish because items on a to-do list are untethered from the constraint of reality: time.**

If someone asks you to do something, go to your calendar and block off time for that task. When people ask, "Can you have this done by Friday?" you can look at your calendar and respond, "I have exactly two hours open this week, so if it's going to take more than two hours, we'll have to change my priorities or I won't get it done until next week."

Using a calendar in this way also helps surface your priorities. Your calendar is often filled a week or two in advance, and being able to take a step back and see what you'll get done next week allows you to ask yourself, "Are these things really the highest and best use of my time?" The answer is often no.

**Takeaway:** Kill your to-do list and use your calendar as your to-do list instead. If you take one action item from this piece, it should be this one.

**Don't let recency determine priority**

One of the most common issues with time management for first-time founders is that they have a set of important tasks that constantly get interrupted by seemingly urgent tasks that come into their inbox.

**Your job as a CEO is to build fire departments, not put out fires.** If you're regularly putting out fires yourself, you're doing it wrong. Focus your time on how to enable others on your team to put out fires themselves.

**If in a year we looked back on this decision, is this the decision that killed the company?** The answer is usually no. Startups are default dead, so you have to ruthlessly prioritize the things that get you to default alive.

**Takeaway:** Use asynchronous tools like email as your primary means of communication and turn off notifications for Slack and other disruptive tools. Mailman lets you batch and set delivery times for email—meaning you only receive email in batches twice a day (2pm and 6pm). This helps you stay focused and cures the habit of compulsively checking email.

**Time spent: Expectations vs. Reality**

One of the most interesting things from tracking time was how different actual time spent was from expectations:

- **Spent a lot less time on recruiting and strategy than expected**
- **Spent a lot more time on network than anticipated**

**Work that is fun, easy, or energizing feels like it takes up less time, while work that is demanding or emotionally taxing feels like it takes up more time than it actually did.**

Recruiting gives anxiety. Searching for people, getting rejected constantly, and awkwardly trying to get introductions is not fun. Sam expected he was spending about 20% of his time on recruiting, but the reality is that he only spent about 3% of his time on it.

**Takeaway:** Be mindful that the way you're actually spending your time might be different than your expectation. You may need to reprioritize.

**The exact breakdown over two years:**

Over two years, Sam spent 7,922 hours total on work-related tasks:

- **Information Processing (mostly email):** ~25% — 3-4 hours per day processing email
- **Network:** ~20% — Quarterly goal of keeping in touch with 1,000 people
- **Team:** ~15% — 1:1s, all hands, collaboration (surprisingly consistent as team grew 10x)
- **Operations:** ~15% — Legal, HR, taxes, catch-all tasks
- **Engineering:** ~10% — Three distinct periods of deep engineering work
- **Sales and Marketing:** ~8% — 600+ personal calls with prospects, user research
- **Strategy:** ~5% — Writing hundreds of pages of strategy docs (less than expected!)
- **Investor Relations:** ~4% — Less than expected, thanks to written updates
- **Recruiting:** ~3% — Way less than expected, despite feeling like it was constant

**Key insights by category:**

**Information Processing:** Being good at email is a crucial skill for a CEO. Be an "inbox 0" person. Use hotkeys for everything. Use snippets for common responses. Block off time specifically for communication—many CEOs treat email like a second-class citizen.

**Network:** Having a strong network is critical. Be good at following up and asking for the right things from the right people. Follow up with close to 100% of the people you talk to. Always have a list of "asks" ready—some of the most important serendipitous events in company history came from being prepared to answer, "How can I be helpful?"

**Team:** Be diligent about getting rid of unnecessary meetings. Be highly skeptical of recurring meetings. Set the expectation that the cadence of meetings like 1:1s is subject to change. Never give updates in meetings—always lean towards asynchronous updates via writing or video (Loom).

**Strategy:** Sam was surprised to see just how little time he actually spent on strategy—only 5% despite writing hundreds of pages. Writing good documentation often takes a lot less time than you'd expect. Consider a quarterly "Think Week"—block off an entire week, go largely offline, and just think and write.

**Sales and Marketing:** The only way to learn who your customers are and deeply understand what problems you can solve for them is to hear their stories first-hand. Sam did 600+ personal calls with prospects in the early days. Still does monthly "community calls" with 6-8 members to listen to experiences and float new ideas.

**Takeaway:** You're probably spending a lot less time on strategy and recruiting than you think you are. But you're probably spending more time on networking than you realize. Track your time to see what's actually happening—it might surprise you.
