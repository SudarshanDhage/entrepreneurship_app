# The Six Elements of CEO Excellence

**The CEO's job is as difficult as it is important.**

What the CEO controls—the company's biggest moves—accounts for 45 percent of a company's performance. Despite the luster of the role, serving as a CEO can be all-consuming, lonely, and stressful.

**Just three in five newly appointed CEOs live up to performance expectations in their first 18 months on the job.**

The high standards and broad expectations of directors, shareholders, customers, and employees create an environment of relentless scrutiny in which one move can dramatically make or derail an accomplished career.

**The six main elements of the CEO's job:**

1. **Setting the strategy** - Setting direction in the face of uncertainty
2. **Aligning the organization** - Matching talent to value, shaping culture, designing for agility
3. **Leading the top team** - Ensuring strong teamwork and effective decision making
4. **Working with the board** - Helping directors help the business
5. **Being the face of the company** - Engaging external stakeholders around purpose
6. **Managing one's own time and energy** - Doing what only you can do

**The gap between excellent CEOs and lesser ones is wide.**

Analysis shows that 30 percent of top-performing CEOs take over from bottom-performing ones and 23 percent of bottom-performing CEOs take over from top performers.

**One thing to keep in mind:** We are not suggesting that an excellent CEO is one who excels at every one of their 18 unique responsibilities. In fact, we've yet to meet one who does. Rather, the best CEOs are ordinarily excellent in a few areas, able in all others, and challenged in none. The more areas a CEO excels in, the better their results tend to be.
