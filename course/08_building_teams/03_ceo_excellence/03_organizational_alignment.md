# Organizational Alignment: Manage Performance and Health with Equal Rigor

**Ask successful investors what they look for in portfolio companies, and many will tell you they'd rather put money on an average strategy in the hands of great talent than on a great strategy in the hands of average talent.**

The best CEOs put equal rigor and discipline into achieving greatness on both strategy and talent. And when it comes to putting great talent in place, almost half of senior leaders say that their biggest regret is taking too long to move lesser performers out of important roles, or out of the organization altogether.

The reasons for this are both practical (good leaders provide the CEO with important leverage) and symbolic (CEOs who tolerate poor performance or bad behavior diminish their own influence). Many CEOs also say they regret leaving adequate performers in key positions and failing to realize the full potential of their roles.

**The best CEOs think systematically about their people:** which roles they play, what they can achieve, and how the company should operate to increase people's impact.

**Talent: Match talent to value.**

Many CEOs have confided to us that they worry about asking the same few overstretched "usual suspects" to take extra assignments because they can't trust the people who would otherwise perform them.

**The best CEOs take a methodical approach to matching talent with roles that create the most value.** A crucial first step is discovering which roles matter most. Careful analysis typically produces findings that surprise even the savviest CEOs.

**Of the 50 most value-creating roles in any given organization, only 10 percent normally report to the CEO directly. Sixty percent are two levels below, and 20 percent sit farther down. Most surprising of all is that the remaining 10 percent are roles that don't even exist.**

Once these roles are identified, the CEO can work with other executives to see that these roles are managed with increased rigor and are occupied by the right people. Robust talent pipelines can also be developed so that important roles remain well staffed. The best CEOs ensure that their own role is included so that the board has viable, well-prepared internal candidates to consider for succession.

**Culture: Go beyond employee engagement.**

Vendors of workforce surveys like to say that employee engagement is the best measure of "soft stuff." It's not. While employee engagement indeed correlates with financial performance, a typical engagement survey covers less than 20 percent of the organizational-health elements that are proven to correlate with value creation.

A proper assessment of organizational health takes in everything from alignment on direction and quality of execution to the ability to learn and adapt.

**In the largest research effort of its kind, McKinsey found that CEOs who insist on rigorously measuring and managing all cultural elements that drive performance more than double the odds that their strategies will be executed. And over the long term, they deliver triple the total return to shareholders that other companies deliver.**

Doing this well involves thoughtful approaches to role modeling, storytelling, aligning of formal reinforcements (such as incentives), and investing in skill building.

**Organizational design: Combine speed with stability.**

"Agility" is one of most widely used and misunderstood management buzzwords of the past decade. For many leaders, agility evokes speed in decision making and execution, as opposed to the deliberate pace dictated by the stable, standardized routines of large organizations.

**The facts show that agility requires no such trade-off: on the contrary, companies that are both fast and stable are nearly three times more likely to rank in the top quartile of organizational health than companies that are fast but lack stable operating disciplines.**

Excellent CEOs increase their companies' agility by determining which features of their organizational design will be stable and unchanging (such features might include a primary axis of organization, a few signature processes, and shared values) and by creating dynamic elements that adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities (such elements might include temporary performance cells, flow-to-work staffing models, and minimum-viable-product iterations).
