# Personal Working Norms: Do What Only You Can Do

**CEOs can easily become overwhelmed, which is understandable given the sheer breadth of their role.**

As the dean of Harvard Business School, Nitin Nohria, has said, "CEOs are accountable for all the work of their organizations. Their life is endless meetings and a barrage of email." Plenty of research also suggests that many CEOs are beset by loneliness, frustration, disappointment, irritation, and exhaustion.

**While no CEO can escape these emotions completely, excellent CEOs know that they will serve the company better by taking command of their well-being.**

**Office: Manage time and energy.**

The most successful CEOs quickly establish an office (often including one or two highly skilled executive assistants and a chief of staff) that makes their priorities explicit and helps them spend their scarce time doing work that only CEOs can do.

For example, a CEO's office should carefully plot all aspects of the CEO's meetings: agenda, attendees, preparation (including "alone time" for the CEO to reflect and get ready), logistics, expected outcomes, and follow-up. CEOs should limit their involvement in tasks that can be dealt with by others and reserve time to deal with unexpected developments.

**The best CEOs also teach their office staffs to help manage the CEO's energy as thoughtfully as their time,** sequencing activities to prevent "energy troughs" and scheduling intervals for recovery practices (for example, time with family and friends, exercise, reading, and spirituality). Doing so ensures that CEOs set a pace they can sustain for a marathon-length effort, rather than burn out by sprinting over and over.

**Leadership model: Choose authenticity.**

Exemplary CEOs combine the reality of what they ought to do in the role with who they are as human beings. They deliberately choose how to behave in the role, based on such questions as: What legacy do I want to leave? What do I want others to say about me as a leader? What do I stand for? What won't I tolerate?

CEOs answer these questions according to their strengths and motivations, as well as the company's needs, and create mechanisms to track how they are doing. Further, by expressing these intentions as part of the rationale for their decisions and actions, CEOs can minimize the risk of unintended interpretations being amplified in unhelpful ways.

**The importance of this can't be underestimated.** As a consumer goods CEO told us, "You are speaking through an extraordinary amplification system. The slightest thing you do or say is picked up on by everyone in the system and, by and large, acted on."

**Perspective: Guard against hubris.**

It's easy for CEOs to become overconfident. While they must push ahead in spite of naysayers at times, they can also tune out critics once they learn to trust their own instincts. Their conviction can increase because subordinates tend to say only what bosses want to hear. Before long, CEOs forget how to say "I don't know," cease asking for help or feedback, and dismiss all criticism.

**Excellent CEOs form a small group of trusted colleagues to provide discreet, unfiltered advice—including the kind that hasn't been asked for but is important to hear.** They also stay in touch with how the work really gets done in the organization by getting out of boardrooms, conference centers, and corporate jets to spend time with rank-and-file employees.

This is not only grounding for the CEO, but also motivating for all involved. Finally, excellent CEOs keep their role in perspective by reminding themselves it is temporary and does not define or limit their self-worth and importance in the world.

**Whereas Steve Jobs advised college graduates, "Stay hungry, stay foolish," we urge CEOs to "Stay hungry, stay humble."**
