## Why Your Company Needs Junior Devs

- **Key Concepts:** Junior engineers, team composition, coaching, knowledge creation, psychological safety, innovation, teaching culture, generalists vs specialists, Protege effect, knowledge transfer
- **Key Insight:** The case for hiring junior engineers. BigTech trend of only hiring elite Staff devs misses the mark - coaching junior employees becomes force multiplier for innovating at scale. Not about added labor, but psychologically safe culture valuing teaching/learning that unlocks innovation. Junior talent forces team to teach, coach, collaborate - key insight from Nonaka and Takeuchi's "The Knowledge-Creating Company": Japanese companies out-innovated Western in 80s/90s because focused on knowledge. Making personal knowledge available to others is central activity of knowledge-creating company. Innovative companies prioritize teaching, spreading, sharing knowledge - ingraining knowledge into company DNA matters more than single developer shipping brilliant feature. Knowledge discovery IS innovation. Teaching helps not just juniors but seniors too - "Protege effect" well-studied phenomenon where teacher's knowledge deepens when required to teach. Juniors force-multiply seniors not by writing code but by forcing seniors to teach and rethink knowledge. Redundancy (overlap in focus area) undergirds this - encourages frequent dialogue/communication, creates "common cognitive ground" facilitating transfer of tacit knowledge. Juniors become this redundancy - absorb company tribal knowledge, reprocess it, internalize it, translate to explicit knowledge, help seniors become aware of assumptions/question/refine them, act as Socratic dialog ensuring on right path. Also practical benefits: fixing bugs, being on-call at 3AM so senior devs don't collapse from burnout. Generalists innovate better than specialists - argument from book "Range". Wright Brothers classic example (non-expert bicycle mechanics invent flying machine), NoSQL databases from distributed systems tinkerers not relational database experts. Juniors ask "dumb" questions - experts through ego/blindness don't see obvious solutions, don't question tacit assumptions. Juniors eagerly crash into/through problems seniors convinced themselves too hard. Juniors try "dumb" things that often fail but sometimes show how blinded experts become from long-held assumptions. Great ideas from junior employees: Jack Dorsey had idea for Twitter as junior employee of podcast company, Post-it notes invented by junior employees Spencer Silver and Art Fry at 3M, Firefox side project of Blake Ross while working at Netscape. Juniors come from more diverse backgrounds than seniors (every sense of word), leading to ways of thinking/perspectives seniors totally miss. Juniors mean psychological safety means more innovation - term from 1999 paper by Amy Edmondson: "Team psychological safety is associated with learning behavior, team efficacy is not" (efficacy = perceived competence). Creating environments where coaching is norm leads to increased psychological safety - team members readily admit mistakes, report errors. Cultures of learning beget psychological safety, psychological safety begets learning, learning and innovation go hand in hand. Contrast with group cohesiveness - stable team of long-term colleagues falls into groupthink, loses ability to innovate, forms immune system to outside ideas/experience. Onboarding anyone (especially juniors) seems annoying chore if colleagues don't enjoy teaching/learning. Entrenched employees live in knowledge silos, not excited to open work to others, lose "learning behavior" muscle. Learning behaviors crucially include ability to experiment - trying new approaches, running more A/B tests, willing to try product directions that don't work out (but sometimes do). Founders talk about "failing fast" but founders/managers can be own worst enemy: wanting only experts who already have all answers, rather than juniors hungry to find new answers. Your org suffers from not hiring juniors - hire juniors that want to learn, hire seniors that want to teach. Those who can't teach, maybe shouldn't be allowed to "do". Ideal team like healthy University research lab - platonic ideal senior open-minded/eager to be challenged, eager to unlearn expertise to find new path. Juniors enthusiastic to absorb knowledge like sponge, asking naive questions that draw out new ideas and shake foundations. High-performing team: individuals open to ideas, eager to share credit, avoid blame, shipping constantly, sharing wins/learnings, believing in team. 50% of puzzle is internal teaching/learning culture, other 50% requires interface to "outside world" that protects team, sells internal chaos as cohesive narrative, works with investors/stakeholders to translate messy experiments into glorious tale of progress. Many executives mistake outer chrome of leadership for entire system, ignoring internal combustion engine of teaching/learning that makes it run.

## No Brilliant Jerks

- **Source:** Brendan Gregg's Blog (brendangregg.com)
- **Author:** Brendan Gregg (Performance engineer and author)
- **URL:** https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-11-13/brilliant-jerks.html
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Brilliant jerks, team composition, toxic employees, company culture, no asshole rule, psychological safety, workplace harassment, team productivity
- **Key Insight:** The engineering jerk who is brilliant but treats others like trash. Why they cost more than they're worth. Two types: (1) Alice (selfless) - brilliant engineer who cares about company, direct/honest, lacks empathy, browbeats others, great at individual work, gets along with immediate team but known as jerk outside team, great at unglamorous work, debatable whether to tolerate (startups may tolerate). (2) Bob (selfish) - brilliant engineer who cares only about Bob, selfish/lacks empathy/delusions of grandeur, charming/charismatic to get way. Bob's behaviors: interrupts/ignores opinions (silences less-assertive engineers), only does work benefiting himself (creates projects claims credit leaves dirty work, never mentors), bullies/humiliates/oppresses (bamboozles non-technical, ridicules juniors, makes people beg for help, shames mistakes), displays dominance (late to meetings on purpose, puts feet up, ignores others, obscene remarks, insists on better equipment), asserts authority over all areas (denigrates areas can't control), negative (trash-talks technologies/companies/people, elevates status by slamming others), manipulates/misleads (presents facts misleadingly, lies confidently, states opinions as facts), physical intimidation (glares, invades space, slams fists), drives good employees to quit (talented engineers driven out on purpose, demonizes those who left), great talks about himself (rewrites history, takes credit for others' work, hero-worshipped from afar), exploits junior engineers (encourages work elevating Bob reflecting glory, they invest in Bob's career not their own), negative role model (others imitate behavior), coworkers become accomplices/gaslight abuse (enablers defend/deny abuse), refuses to change ("that's their problem"). Problems: Alice - hurts/offends employees, causes team to mend fences, projects less successful, wastes expertise. Bob - silences technical opinions (lowers IQ), creates extra work (abandoned projects), demoralizes staff (hurts productivity), causes stress/illness, increases absenteeism, drives staff to quit (strengthens competition), makes hiring difficult, discourages customers/investors, staff work around Bob (reduces efficiency), staff sabotage Bob's work, inspires imitation (multiplies problem), creates hostile environment (lawsuits). Dealing with: Adopt "no brilliant jerks" policy (Netflix example - "cost to teamwork too high, brilliant people capable of decent human interactions"), policy should come from CEO, Alice might change (if understands hurts company), Bob probably won't (believes "nice guys finish last"), regular one-on-ones/skip-levels help inform management, report to management (don't ask to fire, give information let them decide), share public speaking, for management must be convinced behavior shouldn't be tolerated. Personal story: Author acted like jerk (blunt phone call to engineer who made mistake), manager asked two questions: (1) intend to hurt company?, (2) able to act decently? Questions triggered self-reflection more than accusation. Conclusion: Bob definitely should not be tolerated (can kill companies), Alice debatable, early career author thought jerks worth it (was wrong), policy helps decide ("no brilliant jerks" three words). Fred Wilson quote: "I'd rather have a hole in my organization than an asshole." Key takeaways: (1) Don't tolerate brilliant jerks - cost to teamwork too high, (2) The test - do people feel oppressed/humiliated? Target less powerful?, (3) Two types - Alice (selfless debatable) Bob (selfish definitely not), (4) Bob can kill companies, (5) Adopt policy, (6) Regular one-on-ones help, (7) Alice might change, (8) Bob probably won't, (9) Manager's approach - ask questions not accuse, (10) Fred Wilson quote.

## Great Developers Are Raised, Not Hired

- **URL:** https://sizovs.net/mentoring/
- **Date:** Not specified
- **Key Concepts:** Mentoring, hiring strategy, talent development, team building, impostor syndrome, growth mindset, raw diamonds, mentoring capacity, pair programming, career development
- **Key Insight:** A counterintuitive approach to hiring: Instead of searching for the "best talent" that may not exist, companies should focus on building mentoring capacity and raising developers. Hire for attitude, teach technical skills. Core problem: Every company is looking for "best talent" (ideal candidate with all technical skills, culture fit, performs with little supervision), but best developers hired were far from ideal - lacked technical skills, didn't know testing/agile, didn't believe in themselves, had impostor syndrome, didn't sound convincing in interviews. Companies create complicated multi-step interview processes that filter out "not good enough" candidates, rarely give opportunity to candidates spoiled by shitty companies/bad influence, forget some candidates weren't lucky enough to meet inspiring mentor or work in supportive team - "broken toys" not welcome. We prefer hiring self-confident rockstars with solid track record because we fail to create environments where people can grow professionally, develop good habits, become rockstars. Skilled developers don't have time for mentoring (busy coding/architecture), mentoring not part of hiring/delivery processes. Companies spend millions on TA departments, recruiters, promo websites/videos struggling to find best talent, but have talent search problem because searching for best engineers instead of raising them - "everyone is fishing but not much fish left, recruiting more fishers doesn't help, the pond is empty." Solution: Build mentoring capacity - experienced developers should grow less experienced colleagues through pair programming, continuous feedback, career advice, suggest books/blogs/videos, encourage meetups/conferences/workshops. Mentoring requires significant time commitment and excellent communication skills, but is best way to get followers and boost authority/reputation - "your mentees are your fan club" (will support and promote you for rest of life). By building mentoring capacity, can hire newcomers, broken toys, impostors and turn them into loyal high-quality workforce. Shifting focus from assessing to mentoring simplifies interviewing process - instead of trying to predict future performance through tough questions and "nine circles of hell," hire candidates with growth mindset and grow them. Raw diamond analogy: Companies look for polished diamonds and create hiring processes that throw raw diamonds in trash bin. Instead, learn to polish them - create environments where people with eagerness and capacity to learn can become great developers. Four ways: (1) Take money/energy/time spent on recruiting and invest in teaching best developers mentoring skills, give time for mentoring and free them from routine tasks, (2) Adjust interview process and give chance to candidates not good enough yet but eager to learn with growth mindset (raw diamonds), (3) Relax hard requirements in job ads to avoid filtering out impostors (remember most women apply only where they completely fit requirements), (4) Large companies consider creating bootcamp for complete beginners. Core principle: Escape crazy hiring race by creating environment where experienced developers mentor less experienced developers. "Hire for attitude, and teach technical skills. Great developers are raised, not hired." Be the company that says "we are ~~hiring~~ mentoring." Key takeaways: (1) Best developers hired were far from ideal candidates, (2) Companies filter out broken toys, (3) We fail to create environments where people grow, (4) The pond is empty (everyone fishing, not much fish), (5) Build mentoring capacity, (6) Mentoring benefits mentors too (authority, reputation, fan club), (7) Raw diamonds analogy (polish instead of throwing away), (8) Shift from assessing to mentoring (simplify interviewing), (9) Four ways to build mentoring culture, (10) Hire for attitude, teach technical skills.
