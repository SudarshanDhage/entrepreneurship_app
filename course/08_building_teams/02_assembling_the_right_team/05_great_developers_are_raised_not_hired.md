# Great Developers Are Raised, Not Hired

A counterintuitive approach to hiring: Instead of searching for the "best talent" that may not exist, companies should focus on building mentoring capacity and raising developers. Hire for attitude, teach technical skills.

## The Problem with the Talent Search

**Every company on the market is looking for the best talent.** Companies are waiting when "the talent" will appear from nowhere as if there were some secret talent factory. The ideal candidate will have all necessary technical skills, will be a good "culture fit" and will perform well with little or no supervision.

**But there is a problem:**

**The best developers I hired were far from ideal candidates.** They lacked technical skills, didn't know how to test software and work in an agile team. They didn't believe in themselves and their ability. They didn't think they can be good leaders. They didn't sound convincing during the job interview. **Some of them were suffering from impostor syndrome, doubting their actual ability.**

## The Broken Hiring Process

**Today, companies create ridiculously complicated multi-step interview processes that filter out candidates that are "not good enough."** We rarely give an opportunity to candidates spoiled by shitty companies and bad influence. We forget that some candidates weren't lucky enough to meet an inspiring mentor or work in a supportive team. **Broken toys are not welcome.**

**We prefer hiring self-confident rockstars with a solid track record.** The reason is simple – we fail to create environment and work conditions in which people can grow professionally, develop good habits and become rock-stars. Skilled developers do not have time for mentoring, because they are busy with coding and architecture. Mentoring is not part of our hiring and delivery processes. Mentoring is not a buzzword, you can't learn it on Coursera, and it's not visible on a tech radar.

## The Empty Pond

**Companies spend millions on TA departments, recruiters, promo websites and videos, struggling to find the best talent.** We have this crazy talent search problem because companies are searching for the best engineers, instead of raising them. Everyone is fishing, but there is not much fish left. Recruiting more fishers and paying them high commission does not help. **The pond is empty.**

**In the current market situation, every company needs to build a mentoring capacity.** The most experienced developers should find time to grow less experienced colleagues through pair programming, continuous feedback, career advice. We must suggest books, blogs, videos, encourage colleagues to attend meetups, conferences, and workshops.

## The Benefits of Mentoring

**Mentoring is not easy; it requires a significant time commitment and excellent communication skills.** We must encourage engineers to develop mentoring skills. If you are in doubt whether you should invest time in mentoring, I can assure you that mentoring is the best way to get followers and boost your authority and reputation. **Your mentees will support you and promote you for the rest of your life.**

**Your mentees are your fan club.**

**By building mentoring capacity at work, you can hire newcomers, broken toys, impostors and turn them into the loyal, high-quality workforce.** Shifting focus from assessing to mentoring can simplify your interviewing process. Instead of trying to predict future performance by asking tough questions and sending candidate through nine circles of hell, you can hire candidates with a growth mindset and grow them.

## The Raw Diamond Analogy

**Would you send this stone to a trash can?**

A raw stone that doesn't look like a diamond.

**The same stone after careful cutting and polishing:**

Now it's a beautiful diamond.

**Someone has to take a raw diamond that looks like a regular stone, cut it, polish it and voila – you have a beautiful shiny diamond.** Companies are looking for polished diamonds and create hiring processes that throw raw diamonds in a trash bin.

**Instead of throwing diamonds away, we can learn to polish them.** **We can create environments where people with eagerness and capacity to learn can become great developers.**

## How to Build a Mentoring Culture

**How?**

1. **Take some money, energy, time that you spend on recruiting and invest it in teaching your best developers mentoring skills.** Give your best developers time for mentoring and free them up from routine tasks. They will build a workforce that will exceed your expectations.

2. **Adjust your interview process and give a chance to candidates that are not good enough yet, but are eager to learn and have a growth mindset.** They are raw diamonds.

3. **Relax "hard requirements" in your job ads to avoid filtering out impostors.** Remember that most women apply to positions only where they completely fit the requirements.

4. **If you work in a large company and care about our profession, consider creating a Bootcamp for complete beginners.**

## The Core Principle

**You can escape this crazy hiring race by creating an environment, where experienced developers mentor less experienced developers.** **Hire for attitude, and teach technical skills.** **Great developers are raised, not hired.**

**Be the company that says: we are ~~hiring~~ mentoring.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **The best developers hired were far from ideal candidates** - They lacked technical skills, didn't know testing/agile, didn't believe in themselves, had impostor syndrome.

2. **Companies filter out "broken toys"** - Complicated interview processes filter out candidates who weren't lucky enough to meet inspiring mentors or work in supportive teams.

3. **We fail to create environments where people grow** - Skilled developers don't have time for mentoring (busy coding), mentoring not part of processes.

4. **The pond is empty** - Everyone is fishing for the same "best talent," but there's not much fish left. Recruiting more fishers doesn't help.

5. **Build mentoring capacity** - Experienced developers should grow less experienced colleagues through pair programming, continuous feedback, career advice.

6. **Mentoring benefits mentors too** - Best way to get followers, boost authority and reputation. Your mentees will support and promote you for the rest of your life.

7. **Raw diamonds analogy** - Companies look for polished diamonds but create processes that throw raw diamonds in trash. Instead, learn to polish them.

8. **Shift from assessing to mentoring** - Simplify interviewing process. Hire candidates with growth mindset and grow them, instead of trying to predict performance through tough questions.

9. **Four ways to build mentoring:**
   - Invest in teaching best developers mentoring skills
   - Give time for mentoring, free them from routine tasks
   - Adjust interview process for eager learners (raw diamonds)
   - Relax hard requirements (avoid filtering impostors)
   - Consider bootcamp for beginners (large companies)

10. **Hire for attitude, teach technical skills** - Great developers are raised, not hired. Escape the hiring race by building mentoring culture.
