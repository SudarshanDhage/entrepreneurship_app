# Glue Guys

**Glue Guys make their teammates better. They are obsessed with helping their teams win.** We revere Glue Guys. We aspire to be them.

**Our greatest accomplishments and memories have come from being a part of great teams.** I was lucky enough to be a part of Instacart's journey into millions of people's homes and the public markets. Shane won championships at Duke with Coach K and with the Miami Heat alongside LeBron James. Alex mentored Patrick Mahomes…and would have lost his leg if it wasn't for his grit, the support of his family, an incredible set of doctors, and a military rehabilitation center.

**You might think teams are limited to sports and business. In reality, there are teams everywhere.** Even families are teams; moreover, they have multiple teams embedded within them. The one with your parents. The one with your spouse. The one with your children. You need to play a different role on each of them. It's good training for the other teams in your life.

**It's also a good reminder that it's not just our greatest memories and accomplishments that have come from being on great teams. Our most important ambitions and dreams will also only be realized if we are on great teams. If we succeed in being Glue Guys.**

**Glue Guys can be leaders and coaches. They can be superstars. Or they can be waving the towel at the end of the bench.** We know this because we have played each of these roles.

Bill Russell, the ultimate winner and glue guy, has an incredible quote about this: **"My ego demands, for myself, the success of my team."** Damn.

Glue Guys is about business, sports, parenting, fun stories and lots of other things. But most of all, **it's about friendship.**

We hope it helps make you a better leader, a better teammate, a better parent, or a better friend.

**Note:** "Glue Guys" is gender-neutral. It just sounded way better than "Glue People".
