# All Engineers or All Business

One of the factors that lead to startup failure is having the wrong team. This is especially true in technical industries like cybersecurity, but applies everywhere.

**The all-engineering team problem:**

Many security companies are started by two or three security engineers or domain experts who found the problem or identified an opportunity and decided to tackle it. This is often preferred by VCs—at the earliest stage, startup founders need to build the product, and two people can ship code faster than one.

**But there's a dark side:** When things get tough and the company is struggling to acquire customers, all-engineering founders retreat to the area they can control: the code.

Ross Haleliuk has seen company founders doubling down on building new features when what they should be doing is conducting customer discovery and deciding where to focus their efforts strategically. Instead of building the company culture, asking questions to understand what they might be missing, developing partnerships, and addressing other pressing issues, engineering founders often decide to build—more code, more features, more scale.

**The all-business team problem:**

On the opposite side, having a few business people with little to no understanding of the technical side trying to build a company in a technical industry rarely works. This depends on the area/market segment founders choose to tackle—there's a difference between building a tool for compliance teams and a cloud security solution. The former can be done with business understanding alone, but for the latter, having deep technical expertise will be critical.

**What works:**

Having a combination of technical and non-technical founders is ideal. Having 2-3 engineers, some of whom are much more interested in the non-technical side, can work well too.

**Being a solo founder is hard.** In 99 cases out of 100, it's a very bad idea. Most products target enterprise teams, and it's not reasonable to expect that a simple prototype built with no-code can get customers to sign up.

**When it comes to the number of founders:** Two to three founders are ideal; four and more can cause challenges and introduce unnecessary overhead.

**Building a winning team is much more about bringing together people who are clear and transparent about their goals and ambitions** than it is about trying to artificially assemble a certain combination of founder profiles.

Assembling a winning team means working with people who have a bias for action, the ability to execute, and understanding when to talk and when to listen (a skill equally or more important for founders than talking).
