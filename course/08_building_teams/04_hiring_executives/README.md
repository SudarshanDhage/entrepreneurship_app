# Module: Hiring Executives

Executive hires are different from regular hires. You're often dealing with heated competition for a small pool of talent. Competitive compensation packages generally need to be more bespoke, and the challenge is putting together a competitive offer while also balancing the cost and consistency with existing leadership team compensation.
