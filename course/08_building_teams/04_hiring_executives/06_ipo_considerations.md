# IPO Considerations

**For late-stage private companies approaching a potential IPO, executive compensation becomes particularly important for 2 reasons:** the need to disclose executive compensation and the need to transition from stock options to RSUs to avoid overly diluting your existing equity.

**Disclosures**

**A good rule for executive compensation is: if you don't want it out there in the public, don't do it.**

As you approach a potential IPO, you'll be required to disclose some of your executive compensation on registration statements, most typically an S-1. While the specific requirements vary with the size of the company, you should be prepared to disclose the compensation of your CEO, CFO, and next 2–3 highest-paid executives.

**To prepare for these disclosures, we'd recommend setting up a board compensation committee and partnering with an independent third-party consulting firm to help prepare for the needed disclosures about 1–2 years before an IPO.**

These disclosures are often broad and go beyond just base salary, bonus, and equity to capture anything and everything—club memberships, relocation assistance, travel reimbursements, legal fees, security costs—that an executive receives from the company, even if you don't consider it part of the executive's compensation package.

You'll usually need to make these disclosures for the current year, as well as a year or 2 prior. Once you're public, you'll be required to make those disclosures going forward. **If you think there's a compelling business reason for a particular executive expense, have a clear compensation policy that you can use to explain it on the registration statements.**

**Dilution**

**When you're about 2 years from an IPO, equity dilution can become a major gating factor for executive talent, and you'll want to manage your options pool and equity burn rate carefully.** Some companies will set an options pool at 5% and top it up at the end of year, so they can negotiate with talent without having to manage additional shareholder negotiations.

**Additionally, around 18 months pre-IPO, most companies transition from stock options to RSUs.** The company's HR team, in collaboration with the finance, legal, and board compensation committee, will provide recommended grant guidelines based on market competitive grants, as well as a proposed conversion ratio from stock options to RSUs (typically 1 RSU for 2–4 stock options).

**As a best practice, you'd regularly provide your board with a grant budget and track budgeted versus actual grants in conjunction with the board's standard grant-approval process.**
