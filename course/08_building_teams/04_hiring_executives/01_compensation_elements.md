# Compensation Elements

**In the best hiring processes, compensation is part of the discussion between the candidate and executive recruiter from the very beginning,** so that when you decide to make someone an offer, you know their expectations.

Generally, it's best to keep offer letters simple and focused on base salary, cash bonuses, equity or stock options, and change in control (CIC), which includes severance.

**As a note:** While the board won't usually need to approve the compensation package, they will typically approve the equity grant. It's good practice to have your board's compensation committee or the board members involved in the interview process advise on the comp package.

**When putting together the offer, base salary, cash bonuses, and equity, each serves as a different incentive lever.** A good offer uses those levers to get the executive to come on board and to align them to what you need them to do:

**Base salary** establishes guaranteed compensation and fixed income. Growth companies tend to be in a stronger cash position than early-stage companies, so base salaries are generally higher.

**For the best executives, base salary is unlikely to be the reason they take the job, but it can be the reason they don't.**

**Bonuses** incentivize short-term measurable goals (usually 12 months or less). They tend to become more common as a company matures into the later stages and try to balance their long-term incentives (generally equity) with short-term incentives. Sales teams will almost always have some sort of bonus structure as part of compensation, but not all companies have or want to run a bonus plan for non-sales roles.

**If you don't already have a bonus plan in place, a new executive hire isn't the time to implement one.**

**Equity** aligns an executive with your long-term vision and success.

**While competitive offers almost always include great base salaries, your vision—as represented by your equity offer—is what brings executives to the table.** While a candidate may have a base salary range, a good candidate could likely get multiple offers in that range. The reason they say yes to your offer is more likely to come down to how much they believe in your vision, their ability to meaningfully contribute to it, and the value of their equity when they do.

**Change in control** clauses go into effect if your company undergoes a significant change in ownership, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale. By ensuring that executives are financially secure in the event of a change in control that could affect their employment status, CIC clauses align executives with the best interests of the company.

The specifics of these clauses vary widely, but executives typically negotiate severance, accelerated equity vesting, and double-trigger requirements. **Overly generous CIC clauses can often lead to accusations of corporate excess, so as a CEO, it's critical that you balance whatever provisions you offer against the interests of your company.**

**What is the role?**

**Different executive roles tend to have different mixes of compensation, and typically, you'll want that mix to match the time horizon to the role.** Sales leaders, for instance, focus quarterly and thus have variable cash incentives in the form of a bonus or commission that may contribute up to 50% of on-target earnings (OTE). You want a sales executive motivated to hit quarterly goals and keep your company on track in the short-term.

A product executive, on the other hand, works on a longer time horizon when building the product roadmap—often thinking 2–3 years out—so it makes more sense for their compensation to be weighted more toward base salary and equity than toward bonuses.

**Strike the right balance with CIC clauses**

CIC clauses ensure that executives are financially taken care of if the ownership of the company changes. While not all venture-backed companies have adopted these provisions, it's important for CEOs and their teams to understand how they work for 2 main reasons: 1) many executives negotiate these clauses because they provide job "insurance" in the event of any strategic or organizational shifts caused by a change in the company's control, and 2) CIC clauses can impact the price of a merger or acquisition, or derail it altogether, if the management team isn't aligned on their roles post-acquisition.

**As a CEO, it's your responsibility to ensure that CIC clauses center the company's best interests while also aligning your executive bench with the longer-term goals of the company.** Because these clauses can be complex and require careful negotiation, we recommend that CEOs seek legal counsel when drafting these provisions to fully understand how the provisions included in CIC clauses might impact the business in the event of a change in control.

CIC clauses can vary widely from hire to hire, but they generally include:

- **Severance clause:** Provides for special severance benefits in the event of a change of control. This could include a lump-sum payment, accelerated vesting of unvested stock options, continued health benefits, or other provisions.

- **"Triggering" event clause:** Specifies what events qualify as a change in control. Generally, a triggering event occurs when 50%+ of the company's voting power is transferred as part of an acquisition, merger, sale, or other disposition of the company's assets.

- **"Double trigger" clause:** In some cases, the change of control clause might include a "double trigger" provision, which stipulates that 2 events must occur for certain benefits, like severance, to be granted to an employee. This second trigger typically involves termination of employment under specific conditions—sometimes referred to as "good reason"—involuntary termination, or a significant change in the employee's role.

- **"Good reason" clause:** In the event that an executive's role changes significantly after a change in control, "good reason" clauses allow them to trigger their CIC agreement without being formally terminated by the company. "Good reason" clauses generally include significant changes to an employee's compensation, role, or work location, specifically:
  - Protection against a change in role or duties, which ensures that an executive's role stays relatively the same after a change in control
  - Protection against material change, which prevents the company from adjusting the executive's salary lower than 10%
  - Protection against relocation more than 30 miles from their current location that materially increases the commute time from their residence

**Creating incentives, not disincentives, with bonuses**

When it comes to bonuses, it's important to understand what incentives and disincentives a bonus creates, both for the executive and their team.

**You should expect that an executive and their team will optimize for whatever you're measuring—the bigger the potential bonus, the more they will optimize.** For instance, if your company-level goal is a certain topline revenue number, and you tie a bonus to hitting pipeline targets in the next 6 months, your teams will likely be hyperfocused on pipeline generation during that time. If you don't have a clear process for inspecting and qualifying the pipeline, you may be creating a perverse incentive to generate poorly qualified leads in order to make the number.

**Another failure mode with a bonus program is paying out when an executive or team doesn't hit a goal.** Even if the team worked very hard or came close to hitting their targets, by paying a bonus even though the measure wasn't hit, you've created an expectation that future bonuses will be paid, regardless of performance. Be very clear up front about what level of performance is necessary for an executive to receive a bonus.

If you want to avoid all-or-nothing payouts, you can set thresholds at which someone will get 50% or 75% of their bonus. You can also use a structure to incentivize continued performance once the goal is met, so that as someone hits a target, the bonus outcome levers up.

If you do this, you'll want a clear perspective on the financial impact if an executive blows past the initial target. **It's better to set a maximum payment and then use discretion about whether to exceed it.**
