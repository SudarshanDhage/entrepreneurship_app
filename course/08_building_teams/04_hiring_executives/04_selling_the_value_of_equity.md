# Selling the Value of Equity

**Because equity and stock options are based on an uncertain future, equity is only as valuable as a candidate believes it is.** If a candidate believes in your vision and your ability to execute it, they believe in the value of their equity.

**Since selling the value of equity to a candidate is really selling your vision, it's a conversation best handled by you, the CEO.**

**If you're recruiting an executive, especially one from a public company, and find yourself debating the current value of your equity, you're having the wrong conversation.** Your candidate is chasing a dollar amount on the company's current value, but unlike shares in a public company where most of the value has been realized, the real value of your equity is the future upside if you succeed.

**Instead, the conversation you want to have focuses on the overarching goal of your company and how it's structured to hit those goals.** You want to lay out your vision and the key milestones you'll have to hit to get there (i.e., revenue, key customers, product adoption, efficacy) and connect those milestones to your candidate's role.

If you provide a clear understanding of how your company is set up to become a $10B company, and your candidate believes in your ability to get there and their ability to help you get there, the conversation isn't about the current value of their equity, but rather their ability to realize that value.

**Once the candidate is sold on the value of your vision, then you can dig into the specific scenarios and potential value of the equity.** Here, it's helpful to walk through the most recent fundraise and valuation, why investors found it compelling to invest in the company, different exit scenarios, what the company would need to achieve for each of those scenarios, and the resulting value of the executive's equity compensation.

**When highlighting specific outcomes, the more you can explain the potential for the executive to impact the company's future outcomes, the more compelling the equity becomes.**

If the market has changed recently and you've had to adjust your 409A valuation, we typically suggest you explain to candidates that valuations reflect more about the market than about company performance, then focus on selling your ability to create value in the long term.

**Finally, while the strike price matters, candidates sometimes get hung up on differences that won't have as material an impact as they expect.** The bigger the exit, the more valuable the options become and the less relevant the strike price.

For instance, let's compare a set of 10K options granted with a strike price of $1 to 10K options granted at a strike price of $3:

- If a liquidity event occurs at $20 a share, the $1 options are worth $190K, while the $3 options are worth $170K.
- If a liquidity event occurs at $50 a share, the $1 options are worth $490K, while the $3 options are worth $470K.

Models and visualization tools can help present different outcomes and the impact on stock options. In these instances, it can help to play out the math on different strike prices to highlight that the value you create matters far more than a few dollars in the strike price.
