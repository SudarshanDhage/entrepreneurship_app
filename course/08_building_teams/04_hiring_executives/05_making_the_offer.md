# Making the Offer

**If you've run an effective hiring process, by the time you're ready to make a candidate an offer, both you and the candidate should be aligned on expectations for salary, equity, and bonus.**

When it comes to actually making the offer, we typically open the conversation by asking, "Specific details of the offer aside, are you ready to say yes? Are you clear on and excited about the outcomes you need to drive, what you'll need to do, who you'll need to work with, and what you need to be successful?"

Once we know the candidate is ready to say yes, we walk them through the offer verbally and follow up by sending the offer letter.

**If you're extending an offer to a candidate who works for a company known for aggressive counteroffers, you'll want to help the executive prepare to resign and avoid a counteroffer.**

When you're ready to make an offer, discuss the possibility of a counteroffer and ask the candidate:

1. What's their motivation for joining your company?
2. Is there anything their current employer could offer that would convince them to stay?

If you believe the candidate sincerely wants to join your company, and no new role or amount of money would make them stay at their current employer, then make the most compelling offer possible. Once you agree on a compensation package, hold your ground and stay close with the candidate to support them in resigning effectively and onboarding to your company.
