# Benchmarks vs Philosophy

**Competitive market benchmarks are among the key inputs to putting together an offer.** While useful, benchmarks alone are not enough to determine an executive's compensation.

**Rather than a blanket approach of "paying in the 75th percentile," we recommend having a consistent philosophy on how you position executives against the market.** When you need to vary from the baseline, that philosophy is there as a sense-check for your rationale.

For instance, if you want to pay an executive at the 90th percentile for their base salary, that might mean paying someone an extra $150,000 and giving away another half-point of equity, which could be the cost of an early career engineer. Is that where you want to invest your cash and equity? The compensation for that hire may become visible once you're public, so make sure you can explain to everyone why you pay them what you do.

**The smaller or more competitive the talent pool and the more critical your need, the more likely you'll have to pay a higher benchmark.** For instance, a company who wants to hire a chief human resources officer (CHRO) from a public company to lead a shift to a remote-first workplace and ramp up the recruiting process may find the pool of available talent is small given the high level of burnout with HR leaders. To compete for talent, you may need to pay in the 90th percentile.

On the other hand, if you're a company with a single SaaS app product looking to hire a VP of engineering, you may pull from a larger pool of qualified candidates and be able to get the caliber of leader you want by paying in the 50th percentile.

**When benchmarking compensation, we recommend benchmarking the overall size of the compensation package, as well as the specific elements that make up that package, against your competitors for talent, not the whole market.**

For earlier-stage companies, capital raised will typically be the best way to identify similarly sized companies. In the later stages, as the company starts to generate revenue and self-fund cash compensation, we recommend using revenue to scope market data.

It's also important to consider your industry. A company in a more capital intensive industry, such as a biotech company working on drug discovery, tends to raise more capital than similarly sized companies in traditional tech. In these cases, it can be helpful to identify companies with headcounts similar to yours.

If you're looking to recruit from a public company, you'll also want to understand benchmarks for relevant public companies.

**When it comes to actually making the offer, we generally see companies go in at 90%–95% of their maximum on cash and 85%–90% of their maximum on equity and use the promise of equity to move the meter.**

We've generally seen high-quality benchmarking from Pave, Carta, and Radford. It's also important to benchmark your company's compensation against industry standards, for which there are a range of tools available, for industries ranging from biotech to gaming.

**Titles**

Finally, a note on titles. There's been a lot of discussion around title inflation in recent years.

**Some leaders think that when you inflate titles—especially in the early stages—you'll likely end up paying for it in the later stages.** For instance, if you give your sales leader a chief revenue officer (CRO) title and a corresponding compensation package when you have only 70 employees and a handful of sales people, and later you need to bring in a more experienced CRO, the original leader will need to be leveled or perhaps leave the company.

Others, however, find that offering a high-level title can be the key to closing a critical candidate who can jump in, roll up their sleeves, and get your company to where it needs to go. Titles don't correlate to more equity or necessarily more compensation, and they can be an easy way to get a leg up against the competition in the hiring process.

So which approach is better? It depends on your business and how well you can attract the talent you need. In either case, however, **it's critical to run a rigorous hiring and compensation practice.** If you can't define it, you shouldn't hire for it. The best way to get the leader you need is to define the role clearly and then work with your HR leader to determine the title and reporting structure that make sense, given the scope of responsibilities. From there, you'll be able to identify executives in similar roles and establish a compensation range for the position up front.
