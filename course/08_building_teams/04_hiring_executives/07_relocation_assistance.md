# Relocation Assistance

**If you have an executive candidate who will need to relocate, we typically recommend that you have a strategy for relocation, set expectations early in the process, and then include a relocation package with their offer.**

As part of the early conversations around relocation, try to assess whether they're planning to move for the job or were already planning to move. If they were moving anyway, you might not need to offer as substantial a relocation package.

**Generally, a company can provide 3 different types of relocation policies:**

1. **You provide a lump sum.** By offering a lump sum of money, you're telling the executive to "do what they wish" with the money. They might end up pocketing some of the money if they're able to move under budget. Either way, it's an easy hands-off approach that usually satisfies both parties.

2. **You reimburse the executive for relocation costs.** It's important to set a limit on the total amount of the move, which could otherwise quickly get out of control. This option also requires the executive to retain all receipts from the move, which is more work for them. It also requires a dedicated person at the company to monitor the move and expenses. If you're concerned about offering a lump sum, this might be the next-best option for your company.

3. **You hire a third-party relocation firm to handle all the details of the move.** Third-party relocation is an outsourcing of all move logistics, which might even include covering the costs involved in selling a current home. This solution is recommended when: a) The company has the time and money to afford this option, and b) The executive is a critical hire to the company, and you need to make everything as seamless as possible for them.

**We typically recommend the relocation policy cover:**
- The cost of moving household goods and personal effects, including 2–3 months of storage
- The cost of traveling (including lodging), limited to 2–3 trips
- The cost of moving household goods and personal effects to and from storage—limited to 2–3 months

**We recommend it not include:**
- Any part of the purchase price of a new home
- Expenses of buying or selling a home (including closing costs, mortgage fees, and points)
- Expenses of entering into or breaking a lease
- A loss on the sale of a home
- Mortgage penalties

**When setting a budget for relocation packages, keep in mind that much of the time, the executive will come back to you asking for $2K–$5K more than you originally offered, due to unforeseen costs toward the end of their move.** In the case of a C-level executive hire, we find third-party relocation is often the best method, but be prepared that it will cost $50K–75K.

If the executive will be commuting before relocating permanently, you should decide whether that will be part of the relocation budget or a separate expense line item as a part of regular business travel. Additionally, keep in mind that employees will be taxed on all reimbursements, and you may need to consider the after-tax benefit. When setting expectations, it's important you communicate whether this is a gross, net, or after-tax amount.

**When incorporating a relocation package into an offer, it's a good idea to have a clawback clause in the offer letter for a prorated payback to the company if the executive leaves voluntarily or is terminated for cause, usually within the first 12–24 months.** If someone is terminated without cause (such as layoffs), then the relocation money would not be required to be returned.
