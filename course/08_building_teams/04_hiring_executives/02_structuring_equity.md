# Structuring Equity

**Equity is the most complex compensation element, and often the most consequential, when hiring executives.**

**Vehicle type**

When it comes to giving an executive equity, companies typically use three vehicles: incentive stock options (ISOs), nonqualified stock options (NSOs), and restricted stock units (RSUs).

ISOs and NSOs give the executive the option to purchase stock at a set price (known as the exercise price) once they've met predetermined vesting requirements. When you exercise stock options, the difference between the option's strike price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise is considered taxable income.

**For options, ISOs are preferable to NSOs, because ISOs are generally taxed only when an individual sells their shares, whereas NSOs are taxed when the executive exercises the option.** The IRS limits how many ISOs you can grant an individual, and once that limit is reached, ISOs convert to NSOs.

Unlike stock options, which have a strike price (the price at which the option can be exercised), **RSUs are granted at no cost to the employee in a fixed number of units that will convert into company shares upon vesting, which is usually based on 2 triggers: time and a liquidity event (IPO or sale).** RSUs are designed this way so that the executive does not have a tax obligation without the ability to use their liquid stock to cover the tax obligation.

**In the early stages, a company will generally offer stock options rather than RSUs,** because stock option holders will benefit from a gap between their stocks' preferred value (what investors typically invest at) and the 409A value that determines the strike price on options. Granting stock options rather than RSUs takes advantage of this "cheap stock" gap.

**Over time, if the company's 409A valuation increases, this gap diminishes and the strike price on options increases.** Since an executive only realizes the upside on options if the eventual value of the company's stock goes above the strike price, a higher strike price constrains that potential upside. Additionally, the volatility and market dynamics following an IPO could put more recently granted stock options on the open market with a strike price higher than the stocks' trading price.

**RSUs don't necessarily hedge against market volatility directly, but they are a more stable form of equity.** RSUs are granted in a fixed number of units and don't have a strike price. While the value of the underlying shares could still be affected by market volatility, the lack of a strike price means that executives don't need to worry about their RSUs going underwater (i.e., having a strike price higher than the market price).

**As a result, in the later stages, companies transition executives from options to a mix of options and RSUs—for example 75% options (NSOs and ISOs) and 25% RSUs.**

When a company chooses to shift from options to RSUs, it's important to determine an appropriate conversion ratio and adjust grant guidelines for executives accordingly. Stock options require that you pay a strike price, but with RSUs, you're just issued the full share outright, with no obligation to pay a strike price. **Typically, 1 RSU replaces 2–4 stock options.**

When calculating the exact conversion rate, consideration should be given to the intrinsic value of current stock (preferred value less 409A value), the lack of downside risk for RSUs with the lower potential upside based on the smaller number of overall RSUs granted (relative to stock options), and the impact on your share pool reserves.

**When to consider a move to RSUs:**

- Actual company value exceeds $1B, supported by significant revenue growth
- Will reach a head count of 700+ employees within the next 6 months
- Clear path to liquidity in 18–24 months
- Nominal gap between preferred value and 409A value

If they have dilution concerns and high equity burn, and/or an unusually high 409A relative to preferred value, a company may find it makes sense for them to transition to RSUs, even if they don't meet the criteria above.

**Vesting schedule and triggers**

The vesting schedule determines when an executive can exercise options. Typically, ISOs and NSOs vest incrementally over 4 years, contingent on continued employment. Vesting is usually incremental (known as a cliff), with the most common structure being a 25% cliff after the first year and monthly thereafter.

**In the case of RSUs, vesting occurs and stock is granted automatically once certain conditions are met. Vesting conditions can be either single- or double-trigger.** We strongly recommend setting up double-trigger vesting, with the primary trigger being time-based and tied to continued employment, and the secondary trigger usually related to a liquidity event (e.g., an IPO, acquisition).

If RSUs carry only a single trigger of time-based vesting, employees who vest prior to a liquidity event will have taxable income without the ability to easily sell shares to cover their tax liability.

**Refresh and promotion grants**

**You don't want to end up in a position where an executive's equity is predominantly vested.** Generally, executives with more than 2 years of tenure who are performing in their role should be eligible for a refresh grant, or a grant that layers on additional options.

Refresh grants for executives tend to be around 0.25x, or even as high as 0.3x, of the new hire grant. For comparison, the average employee will typically be refreshed at 0.10x–0.15x (for top performers 0.15x–0.20x). Executive refresh grants are generally greater than those of broad-based employees because employees are still growing into their roles. **For a growth-stage executive, the expectation is that if they're still there, they're performing.**

**Post-termination exercise**

For RSUs, an executive will have the right to any vested shares with no taxable income recognized until a liquidity event (assuming RSUs require a double-trigger vesting).

For ISOs and NSOs, you may choose to extend the post-termination exercise window beyond the standard 90 days. If you do take this approach, a best practice is to use an executive's years of service to determine how long after employment ends an executive has the ability to exercise options (i.e., a post-termination exercise window). The most common structure provides an incremental year of post-termination exercise after 2 years of service.

**Companies that extend the post-termination exercise window out over years run the risk of carrying "dead equity," putting additional pressure on dilution, and so, many companies cap the window at 2–3 years.**
