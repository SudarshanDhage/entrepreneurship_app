# Alter Ego vs Alter Zero

There's no rule in terms of who you work with. But it's kind of like a wedding: **don't get married to the first person who comes along.**

Or at least test how things go for a few months. Don't commit to someone just because you need their (rare) hard skill—like web developers. Skills can be learned. Or you'll be able to hire people in a few months if you have customers.

**Find someone you'll be happy to share the journey with for the next 20 years.**

Find someone you admire for their soft skills, their behavior. Actually, **find someone you simply love.**

**Entrepreneurship is really a human game.** Even if you're very good, there will be hard knocks and mountains to overcome. Doing it with and for someone you love will be much easier. You'll give yourself many more chances to succeed.

**How do you maintain this love in the long run?**

Work on communication. Go have dinner with your co-founder(s) every week/month. Get the good bottle of wine. **Talk about the hard things, the things which are hard to hear but which if they are settled quickly, will bring immense value to your project and reinforce your relationship.**

**And what if you don't find anyone to join you?**

Start alone. If what you do is cool, you'll find someone along the way: a friend of a friend at a party, a customer, a first employee who's becoming more than that, someone who discovered you by chance...

**Just don't wait.**

**NB:** Oh and yes, even if you had the idea, started for 6 months, and after 6 months you meet your great entrepreneurial love—don't be dumb. Bring them in for 50%. It's all about trust and building something together.
