# What a Startup Really Is

Most students say they want to launch a "startup." But after 80 events and 5000 attendees across France, Maxime Blondel noticed something: **people call almost anything and everything new a startup.**

You want to start a restaurant? Cool. But unless you're reinventing the business model (like Subway did in the 1960s with their smaller kitchens), it's not a startup.

**So what is a startup, really?**

Three words: **Profitable. Repeatable. Scalable.**

**Profitable** means you can make more money than you spend. Not on day one—Amazon took years. But you need a clear path to get there.

**Repeatable** means your product could launch in most places globally without rebuilding from zero. The Uber app in San Francisco is the same as in Paris. Google searches the same in Montreal and Porto. These are products, not services. Users create value themselves—ordering drivers, searching information, creating content.

**Scalable** is the killer feature. In economics, scalability means:
- Decreasing variable costs over time (serving each new customer costs less)
- Growing revenue per customer over time

Want to launch a design agency? You're selling human time. If it works, you need more employees, bigger offices. Your costs grow proportionally. **Not scalable.**

Google? Every new search query costs less than the previous one. Revenue grows higher. **That's scalability.**

At the beginning, Google lost money on each search. Server costs too high, revenue low. After years of engineering and automated ads? Pure scalability.

**The difference?** PRODUCT (not service). DAILY/WEEKLY GROWTH OF CUSTOMERS/USERS.

Building a startup is risky. You're searching for a new business model in old industries. Trying to take over continental or worldwide markets in 10–20 years. Plus luck. Plus unpredictability.

**There's no reason to build a startup except if you really want to build an empire.**
