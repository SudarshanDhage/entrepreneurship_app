# Avoiding Junk Markets

"What do you think of my startup idea? How do I find a good one?"

These are probably the two questions Maxime Blondel gets asked most.

At The Family, they don't judge ideas—it's too hard. But they've developed instincts about **whether problems are real and the quality of different markets.**

**Ask yourself:**
- Are my future clients good ones or bad ones?
- Do they have money?
- Are there a lot of them, or will there be a lot more over the coming years?

Blondel recently heard from two students wanting to "add blockchain in EdTech to certify diplomas." Too many buzzwords aside, school administrations are **bad clients.** Few of them globally. Rigid processes. Negotiations take forever. The jackpot? Not that huge.

Plus, blockchain for diploma certification doesn't solve the real problem. The real problem is reinventing how skills are taught, how programs are crafted, how bridges are built with recruiting companies.

**Ask yourself:** Is my problem real, strong, and will it grow in the coming years in a way that warrants putting all my intensity into it?

**But here's the thing:** At the beginning, startup ideas are always weird. Counterintuitive. Seem unrealistic, even crazy.

A year ago, scooters were uncool and old-fashioned. QR codes were only in bad subway ads. Today? Lime, Bird, and Jump are everywhere. That's the foresight you need.

Electric scooters (transportation), Netflix (entertainment), Airbnb (travel hosting) were funny ideas on **big markets.**

**How to find good markets:**

1. **Look at B2C trends and adapt to B2B.** Slack was inspired by Facebook Messenger.

2. **Find habits adopted by minorities** (wealthy people, traveling freelancers, tech lovers). Can you make it a commodity for the masses? Did your parents imagine accessing a private driver in a nice sedan with a button push? Uber.

3. **Take a global success and target a specific population.** Kard (black card for teenagers), Kymono (premium clothing for startups), Merci Handy (anti-bacterial gel for unicorn lovers).

4. **Dream big.** "Imagine if we could reinvent agriculture, produce fruits without pesticides, without GMOs, extremely tasty..." That's Agricool. The best way to predict the future is to build it.

5. **Find old industries with poor user experience.** Rework them to become amazing. Payfit. No conflict, no interest.

6. **Look at human vices** for consumer mobile apps. Sad but true—the big hits are built around this: Instagram ("My life is better than yours"), Wish (compulsive buying), Snapchat (sexting).

7. **Look for taboos and unspoken things.** Men have trouble talking about erectile problems? Now they have Charles.

**The key:** Real problems on big markets. That's where startups succeed.
