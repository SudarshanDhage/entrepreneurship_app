# If Everyone Loves Your Idea

"If everyone loves your idea, I might be worried that it's not forward thinking enough."

That's what Chris Dixon says. And it might be the most counter-intuitive insight in entrepreneurship.

Think about it: Shouldn't we want people to love our ideas?

**Turns out, no.** At least not immediately.

The best entrepreneurs search for mispriced opportunities—places where markets haven't fully priced in value yet. While markets are mostly efficient, there are always areas of significant uncertainty. Those are the gold mines for startups.

Large businesses invest huge capital in areas where information is already available. Smart founders go where information isn't. Where things are overlooked. Where most people don't see what you see.

If everyone loves your idea right away? That might be a "tell" that there won't be opportunities for extraordinary profit. Peter Thiel put it perfectly: "The best startups are good ideas that look like bad ideas. Good ideas that look like good ideas are already being worked on by big companies."

But here's another thing: **"You shouldn't keep your startup idea secret."**

Dixon points out there are positive benefits from sharing and getting feedback. And realistically? "There are at best a handful of people in the world who might actually drop everything and copy your idea."

Most people won't. And the ones who might? They probably have their own ideas they're working on.

**So what's the tension?** If everyone loves it, maybe it's too obvious. But if it's too secret, you're missing out on feedback.

The key: Look for ideas that seem weird or bad to most people—but you understand something they don't. That gap? That's where the opportunity is.
