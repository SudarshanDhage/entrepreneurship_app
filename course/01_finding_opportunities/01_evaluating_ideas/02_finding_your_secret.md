# Finding Your Secret

"How do you develop a good idea that looks like a bad idea? You need to know a secret—in the Peter Thiel sense: something you believe that most other people don't believe."

That's the question Chris Dixon poses. And the answer determines whether your startup has a real shot.

**How do you develop a secret?**

Dixon gives three paths:

**(a) Know the tools better than anyone else**  
**(b) Know the problems better than anyone else**  
**(c) Draw from unique life experience**

These aren't separate paths. They often combine. But the common thread? **Deep domain expertise.**

People without deep domain expertise rarely succeed. You need to understand:
- The technology
- How to create the product
- How to bring products to market
- What customers actually need

Another way to think about it: **Founder/market fit.**

David Lee calls it this: Founders have to choose a market long before they know if they'll reach product/market fit. The best predictor of success? Whether there's "founder/market fit." Founders with deep understanding of their market—people who "personify their product, business, and ultimately their company."

Your secret doesn't just give you an advantage. It creates what Dixon calls "optionality." When a team has secrets from deep domain expertise, they can adapt and innovate. Teams without this optionality? They usually can't adapt when environments change. They fail more often.

The other skill that comes with deep understanding: **Seeing patterns before others.** When something bigger than the sum of its parts is emerging in an economy, people with deep domain expertise spot the potential first. They see the secret before everyone else does.

So if you're evaluating an idea, ask: Do I know something most people don't? Do I have an unfair advantage? Or am I just hoping for the best?

The first can work. The second rarely does.
