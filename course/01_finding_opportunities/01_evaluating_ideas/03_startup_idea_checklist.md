# Startup Idea Checklist

**"If you adopt it, be careful about using it as a filter. Remember that in the early stages, good ideas are very easy to kill."**

A comprehensive checklist to think through startup ideas, covering Product, Growth, Strategy, and Meaning. Use this list both to develop ideas and filter them.

## Product

### Who are the users?
**<= 70 chars**

Don Valentine: "Who cares?"

### What is the essence of their dissatisfaction?
**<= 240 chars**

If they read this answer, would they say "thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way"?

@benedictevans: "The iTunes Store solved a user problem. So did the App Store. And so did Spotify and Apple Music, and indeed Apple News. But what user problem is solved by Apple's commissioning TV shows?"

### What are you building for them?
**<= 70 chars**

Peter Drucker: Is the product being designed for the customer, or at the customer?

### Write a tweet from a hypothetical customer
Explain the product and how it eliminates their dissatisfaction.

@BrianNorgard: "No one cares about your product. Who built it, its features, the origin story — it's all superfluous. People only find value in what your product can do for them right now. Save people time. Save people money. Give people an escape. The selfish hand will always govern."

Peter Drucker: Are you really doing the best you can to help the customer?

### Write a blog post title for your product launch
Is it surprising? Is it new? Will your target customers want to click on it? Will they want to share the link? Will they still share it the next day?
**<= 70 chars**

### Write the first paragraph of your product announcement blog post
Include the product name, an explanation of what the product is, the target market, the main benefit, and the call to action.
**<= 240 chars**

### What "metrics of goodness" do your target customers care about?
Does your product dominate every available alternative on these metrics? (i.e. what can you do that no one else can do?)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Use this for development, not just filtering.** In early stages, good ideas are very easy to kill. Be careful about using this as a filter.

2. **Product questions focus on:** Who are the users? What's their dissatisfaction? What are you building? Does it dominate on metrics that matter?

3. **Growth questions focus on:** Market size, early adopters willing to tolerate bugs, first 10 customers, playbook for growth, path to cheap capital.

4. **Strategy questions focus on:** Why now? Long-term vision (25 years), credible advances, and moats.

5. **Meaning questions focus on:** Impact on the world, personal commitment, and willingness to face failure.

6. **The character limits force clarity.** Each question has a character limit that forces you to be clear and concise about what matters.
