# Ideas from Direct Experience

"Ideas matter, just not in the narrow sense in which startup ideas are popularly defined."

Chris Dixon's point: Good startup ideas aren't elevator pitches. They're well-developed, multi-year plans that contemplate many possible paths as the world changes.

**Characteristics of the best ideas:**

**(a) Powerful people dismiss them as toys**  
**(b) They unbundle functions done by others**  
**(c) They often start off as hobbies**  
**(d) They often challenge social norms**

But here's the key: **"The best ideas come through direct experience. When you differentiate your direct experience from conventional wisdom, that's where the best startup ideas come from."**

Tren Griffin worked for Craig McCaw during the early days of mobile phones. The "cell phone" only offered value to a tiny number of users. The device was so big it needed a suitcase or car installation. Real estate agents and construction sites were the biggest users.

Then mobile phones appeared—expensive, analog, heavy, large. During that time, McKinsey famously predicted no one would ever use a mobile phone if a landline was available.

**They missed what McCaw saw:** The ability to be "nomadic."

The mobile phone had every attribute Dixon listed:
- People thought it was a toy
- It unbundled communication from location
- It started as a niche tool
- It challenged social norms (using a phone in public was awkward)

But here's the crucial part: **Craig McCaw was an enthusiastic personal user.** He loved working out of the "mobile office"—cars, planes, boats, ships. He was a natural enthusiast for the product. When it came time to sell his cable TV business to double down on mobile phones, the choice was easy because of his personal love for it.

That's direct experience leading to conviction. And that's where the best startup ideas come from.

Not from market research. Not from following trends. From living the problem yourself and seeing something others don't.
