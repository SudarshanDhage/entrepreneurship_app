# What Smart People Do on Weekends

"What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years."

That's Chris Dixon's observation. And it's a pattern worth paying attention to.

He's not talking about ping pong or fantasy baseball. He's talking about people building the first PCs, drones, or better search engines. The Homebrew Computer Club had its first meeting on March 5, 1975. Those hobbyists? They were building what would become mainstream.

**The pattern:** Advanced technologies useful to smart hobbyists—but without obvious financial returns yet. Then Moore's Law kicks in. Costs drop. Performance rises. What was once an expensive hobby becomes something everyone can use.

"Hobbies are what the smartest people spend their time on when they aren't constrained by near-term financial goals."

That's the key: When financial pressure is off, what do you build? What problems do you solve? What tools do you create?

That weird weekend project? That thing you're building just because it's interesting? **That might be your next startup.**

Here's what's happening: Technologies driven by phenomena like Moore's law eventually drive costs low enough and performance high enough that hobbies become businesses. It happened with computers. It happened with drones. It's happening now with AI, with biotech, with space technology.

So if you're technical, build things on weekends. Experiment. Play. Follow curiosity.

That project that doesn't make business sense yet? That might be exactly what everyone needs in ten years.
