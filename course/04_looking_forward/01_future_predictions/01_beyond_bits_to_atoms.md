# Beyond Bits to Atoms

"This era of technology, it seems to be the core theme is about moving beyond bits to atoms. Meaning technology that affects real world, and transportation and housing and healthcare and all these other things, as opposed to just moving bits around."

Chris Dixon said this in 2015. And those areas? They tend to be more heavily regulated. This issue, he predicted, would be "the defining issue of the next decade in technology."

This is an example of something valuable: **The ability to make genuine non-consensus predictions about the future, rather than predicting the present.**

Too many venture capitalists are camp followers. They move into trends when others have long since moved on. To outperform, you need to think like Howard Marks describes:

"To achieve superior investment results, your insight into value has to be superior. Thus you must learn things others don't, see things differently or do a better job of analyzing them—ideally all three."

Deviating from consensus for its own sake? Suicidal. But doing it occasionally and being very right? That's what makes a great venture capitalist.

**The lesson isn't just about this specific prediction.** It's about thinking ahead. About seeing patterns before others. About having conviction when others don't see what you see.

The best investors don't follow trends. They identify them before they're trends. They see where technology is heading, not just where it is.

And often, that means moving from pure software (bits) to real-world impact (atoms). It means dealing with regulation. It means understanding industries beyond tech.

That's where the future is. And recognizing it early? That's the advantage.
