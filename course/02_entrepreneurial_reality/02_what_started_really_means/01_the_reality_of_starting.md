# The Reality of Starting

Before starting his first company, an experienced entrepreneur pulled Chris Dixon aside: "Get ready to feel sick to your stomach for the next five years."

Chris thought: "Eh, whatever."

Later, he realized: "Shoot, I should have listened to that guy."

**"You've either started a company or you haven't."**

And "started" doesn't mean:
- Joining as an early employee
- Investing or advising
- Helping out

It means:
- Starting with no money, no help
- No one who believes in you (except maybe closest friends and family)
- Building an organization from a borrowed cubicle
- Credit card debt
- Nowhere to sleep except the office

It almost invariably means:
- Being dismissed by arrogant investors who show up half an hour late, totally unprepared
- Getting non-committal rejections like "we invest in later stage companies"
- Looking prospective employees in the eyes and convincing them to leave safe jobs
- Having pundits who've never built anything criticize you
- Armchair quarterbacking your every mistake
- Lying awake at night worrying about running out of cash
- A constant knot in your stomach, fearing you'll disappoint the few people who believed in you

This isn't complaining. It's the reality.

Tren Griffin was the third employee of a company founded by Craig McCaw. Even as an employee, not a founder, it was life-changing. He received two job offers the same day: one safe position at an established company, one at the startup.

What tipped the decision? He wanted the experience. More than immediate monetary rewards.

From Chris Dixon on climbing the wrong hill: "People tend to systematically overvalue near-term over long-term rewards. This effect seems to be even stronger in more ambitious people. Their ambition seems to make it hard for them to forgo the nearby upward step."

There were lots of times Griffin thought he'd made a mistake. He experienced all the things Dixon talks about—including attacks from armchair critics. He worried about other employees. He worried about how his family would cope with failure.

**But understanding what you're signing up for—and having the stomach for it—is essential.**

This isn't a warning to avoid it. It's a reality check so you know what you're choosing.
