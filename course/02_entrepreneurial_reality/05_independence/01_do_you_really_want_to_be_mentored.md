# Do You Really Want to Be Mentored?

Yes, you want people to surround you. Your friends, your family, maybe advisors you really believe in.

**But if you're building something that disturbs the established landscape, you don't want a mentor (i.e., an old person) telling you what to do or not.**

Old people don't live in the same world as you. They will tell you it's impossible. **Please, be rebellious.**

With that in mind, some incubators are good. Some. But **most incubators are not designed to make you succeed—they're designed to make you stay and pay the rent.**

**Entrepreneurs are independent! Entrepreneurs are pirates!**

You have to feel and act like you're fighting for that independence, your ideas & your vision of the world.

Mathias & Younès from The Family have both written about it:

- Universities' Entrepreneurship Programs Are Rotten
- Your University Doesn't Really Care About Your Startup

Don't let old structures tell you what's possible. Don't let incubators trap you. Don't let mentors limit your vision.

**You're a pirate. You're independent. Fight for it.**
