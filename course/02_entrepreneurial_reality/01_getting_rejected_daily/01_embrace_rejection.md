# Embrace Rejection

"If you aren't getting rejected on a daily basis, your goals are not ambitious enough."

That's Chris Dixon's line. And it comes from personal experience.

When he was starting out, trying to break into tech, he applied to jobs at big companies, startups, VC firms. Got rejected everywhere. Unusual background: philosophy major, self-taught programmer.

**It turned out to be the most valuable experience of his career.** Why? Because he eventually developed such thick skin that he just didn't care anymore about getting rejected. And then he turned it around—started embracing it. That emboldened him. Through bolder tactics, he eventually landed a job that got his first startup funded.

"So every day to this day I try to make sure I get rejected."

**The ability to handle rejection is fascinating.** Why can some people knock on door after door, suffer rejection after rejection, and still maintain a positive attitude long enough to generate the eventual sale? For some people, a single rejection turns them into a nervous wreck. Others power through to close.

It seems to be a combination of innate personality and a learned skill.

**But here's the thing:** Starting a business—and even building a successful career—involves way more selling than people imagine. Entrepreneurs are constantly selling:
- Themselves
- Their business
- Their products

To potential employees, suppliers, distributors, investors, and customers.

**If you can't sell, starting a business is probably unwise.**

And if you can't handle rejection? You won't last long. Because rejection isn't a bug in the process. It's a feature. It means you're pushing boundaries. It means you're ambitious. It means you're trying.

Get comfortable with it. Better yet—embrace it.
