# Put In More Intensity

"I won't lie to you, it's going to be hard. Mentally and physically."

That's Blondel's warning. And it's real.

**So:**

1. **Energy will be your #1 ally.**

2. **Surround yourself with people who have already done it.**

At The Family, they see their job as similar to coaches of high-level athletes. They bet on crazy ambitious people. They're looking for golden nuggets, hidden pirates, black swans. They make every effort to help them become Usain Bolt, Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams.

**What they've learned:** Startups are a marathon made up of sprints. Hard work over the long run will pay off. All the greats, even more than having rare physical and mental talents (and luck), **worked intensely for years before winning it all.**

For that, you need to be a **missionary, not a mercenary.** That's why all the tips are related: they all refer to intensity, passion & coherence.

**Beautiful stories only come from passionate people who work long and hard, because they had no option but to do what they were doing.**

If you're not ready for that intensity—mentally and physically—you're not ready for a startup.
