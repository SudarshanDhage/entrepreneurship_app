# Pirates Are in Rare Supply

If you're launching a startup, you must see it as **an act of rebellion.** You're embarking on a legendary adventure, a Trojan horse that wants to enter the great fortress to burn it down and reinvent a new world.

**Stop wanting to partner with big corporations. You are a pirate!**

Embrace the hacker mindset. As all those who have partnered with big corps will tell you, you don't want to be in that kind of relationship daily. Assume you're there to overturn the cart, to move fast & break things—as the famous Facebook adage went.

**Realize:** Our internet generation has an economic & leadership opportunity never before seen in history.

Because the internet made access to information free (YouTube, Coursera). Because the internet allows everyone to distribute their voice. Because executing is now a commodity with all the (almost) free tools available.

**You really can have a global impact from your room, without needing much in terms of resources or money.**

**Need a concrete example?** Take a look at the story of Oobah Butler, the most emblematic hacker of our generation, in Blondel's opinion.

Don't play by old rules. Don't seek permission. Don't try to fit in.

**Be a pirate. Move fast. Break things. Reinvent the world.**
