# Are You Ready?

"If you're not ready to stop your studies if your project skyrockets, that's ok. Just do other entrepreneurial projects. Do 'stuff.' Don't do a startup."

At The Family, they never advise anyone to drop out. Why? **Because if you're debating it in your head, it's already too late. You would have already done it if you really wanted to.**

Dropping out is not for everyone. It's super risky. It's always better in life to finish what we've started.

**So what can you do to prepare to launch your startup at the end of your studies?**

**Many things:**

- **Develop your creativity** by taking time to do things you love: painting, playing & composing music...
- **Create what is wrongly called a "network"**—i.e., friends. Take part in sports clubs, student associations...
- **Launch side projects** like muses, passive income projects... Try setting up an online business (dropshipping, marketplace, selling rare knowledge via video or PDF...). You'll discover digital tools and better understand the economic process of distribution & exchange of value.
- **Take time to learn key things for the future:** Learn the basics of coding if you don't already. Learn to sell if you think you're bad at it.

People tend to underestimate the value of these little things. But these are often the foundations of rich and vibrant entrepreneurial destinies.

**Start with "stuff."** Build side projects. Learn. Create. Then, when you're ready, launch your startup.
