# Distribution Is Harder Than You Think

**The biggest challenge of cybersecurity startups is not the product; it's distribution.**

There are no right answers, but there are plenty of wrong ones.

One of the most common mistakes: focusing heads-down on building the product instead of allocating time to figure out distribution. Many wrongly believe that the product will sell itself.

In practical terms, it typically looks like this: A few practitioners experienced a painful problem, saw an opportunity to bring a better solution to market, and inspired by tech podcasts and articles, developed the conviction that they can just "do product-led growth (PLG)".

**PLG is not the same as "build it and they will come."**

Many entrepreneurs find comfort in thinking they can build cool products, and people looking for alternatives will inevitably find them, get excited about the tech, and ask "Where do I punch my credit card number?" Unfortunately, it's rarely that simple. Success is never just a by-product of having a great product.

**The "we will get a CISO into a demo" strategy also doesn't work.** Most cybersecurity startups cannot turn cold calling and email spam into a viable growth strategy, especially if they're selling to security leaders.

**What else is possible?**

- **Investor introductions.** Those selling to CISOs should know that Fortune 500 security leaders tend to buy products based on introductions from their venture capital networks. Being funded by the "right" VC can be the difference between getting the ability to demo the solution and being discarded as junk email.

- **Security-adjacent functions.** The ownership of several emerging areas isn't clearly defined yet, which presents opportunities to target people outside the security team who can influence buying decisions. Software engineering, data analytics, human resources, procurement, finance—all have stakes in cybersecurity buying decisions.

- **Channel partners and marketplaces.** As the channel partner ecosystem evolves, savvy founders may find new ways to acquire and retain customers.

- **New ideas for distribution.** The landscape is constantly evolving. A lot of what appears obvious and crowded today wasn't so just a few years ago.

**Another challenge:** Underestimating the amount of effort required to fully adopt the solution. When founders say they consolidate 5-10 tools, they often forget how many resources it takes for customers to rip and replace ten different solutions. Aside from technical considerations, there's also change management, different teams managing different solutions, separate contracts requiring cancellation, training and enablement documentation, and so on.

**Having the ability to insert the solution ("land and expand") is always superior to any "rip and replace" strategy.** For that, the new solution must offer additional value that can be layered over (and co-exist) with the tool it may eventually replace. The more grandiose the change, the more excited founders typically get—and the more likely it is that the friction at the enterprise will be too high to move forward.

To address the challenge of distribution, founders can pick a niche and become intimately familiar with the buying process, habits, and patterns in this niche. They have to be realistic and understand that buying decisions are complex. A solid distribution machine is a must for any company looking to grow.
