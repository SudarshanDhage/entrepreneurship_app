# The 40% Rule

**"Your annual revenue growth rate + your operating margin should equal 40%."** —Brad Feld

This is the 40% rule for SaaS companies, a simple framework for balancing growth and profitability.

## The Rule

Your annual revenue growth rate + your operating margin should equal 40%.

### Examples:

- **If you are growing 100% year over year**, you can lose money at a rate of 60% of your revenues
- **If you are growing 40% year over year**, you should be breaking even
- **If you are growing 20% year over year**, you should have 20% operating margins
- **If you are not growing**, you should have 40% operating margins
- **If your business is declining 10% year over year**, you should have 50% operating margins

## The Logic

I've never seen growth and profitability so nicely tied together in a simple rule like this. I've always felt intuitively that it's OK to lose money if you are growing fast, and you must make money and increasing amounts of it as your growth slows. Now there's a formula for that instinct.

## When This Applies

**Important caveat from Fred Wilson:** "None of this matters until you find PMF. That is the single most important thing and you must do it before investing in growth."

There is a relevant range for this metric. It likely applies to companies that are past a certain size—perhaps $3 million in ARR or so. Growth rates can be very high over a small base for early stage companies, yet the company can also be running a high burn as it invests in market education, early adoption and, in enterprise sales, building a library of APIs that will carry over to other customers. This metric may be simple, but applying it to early stage companies may actually cause them to restrain spending when they should be pouring on the gas.

## Nuances and Limitations

### The 40% is a Benchmark

When we use terms like "rule", "formula" and "logic", we should be clear that the 40% rule is a **benchmark**. It matches the experience of certain successful SaaS companies. There is no logic that it can't (or shouldn't) be 50%. 40% might be a minimum for some VCs at certain stages.

### Context Matters

Growth and profitability are mutually dependent variables. The choice to be profitable at a certain level in a specific period can fuel or limit growth. Similarly, extent of growth, the mix of customers and their life-time value drives how much margin flows to the bottom-line.

Does the 40% rule apply at all times post PMF? There's a risk that it can be misinterpreted by companies to drive to wrong decisions. For example, when the underlying market is growing at 50% but your company is growing at 20% due to flawed execution or sub-standard product, you may want to address this by investing more in the short-term (at the expense of profitability) so that you can get back to high growth.

**The size, dynamics and growth rate of the underlying market (and its adjacencies) are critical** to find the balance between how much profits to extract vs. how much to invest.

The 40% rule is a great way to ensure you are not going over-board in any direction, but it cannot be used as a standard formula in all situations. Companies with multiple products and multiple customer segments also need to balance the different stages of market and product evolution, and find the best way to optimize across these opportunities.

**Each company at a point in time is a unique case.** It's level of spending/investments in any time period should ideally be the outcome of a deliberate and well thought out strategy that reflects the trade-offs made by the management team and board.

### What You're Losing Money On Matters

Obviously it makes a great difference (the details) on what exactly you are losing money on, the details do matter. Exactly how and what you spend your money on is really important to survival.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Find PMF first.** None of this matters until you find product-market fit. That is the single most important thing and you must do it before investing in growth.

2. **Use the 40% rule as a benchmark**, not a rigid formula. It's a guide to ensure you're not going overboard in either direction.

3. **Context is critical.** The underlying market dynamics, company stage, and specific situation matter. The rule applies best to companies past a certain size (perhaps $3M+ ARR).

4. **Understand what you're spending on.** It's OK to lose money if you're growing fast, but details matter—exactly how and what you spend your money on is really important.

5. **Balance growth and profitability intentionally.** As growth slows, profitability should increase. This isn't just about hitting a number—it's about making deliberate strategic trade-offs.
