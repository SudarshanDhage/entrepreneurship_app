# Understanding Engagement Loops

**The key question with engagement:** If you have a network-based product like Dropbox or Slack, you need active users to engage each other. If it's purely a utility, you want engagement in one time period to help set up engagement in a future time period.

**Examples:**

**Social feedback loops:** A game of ping pong. One user messages/follows/mentions another, and they draw them back. Then that user might do the same, and draw in a different user. This repeats. This is why achieving network density and easy content creation is so important—you need ways to bring people back into the network.

**Planting seeds loops:** Zillow—sign up, put in your home address, favorite listings. Zillow re-engages you with personalized emails when your house goes up in value or new listings show up. Credit Karma is the same—single setup session leads to important notifications about credit score changes over time.

**Physical reminders:** Rideshare, where seeing physical on-the-street reminders prompts you to use it. Mapping works similarly—often starting with "I'm lost!"

**Just like acquisition, there are linear channels to re-engage users.** Marketing-driven one-off email campaigns. These are useful but don't scale, aren't interesting to users, and with enough volume can cause folks to churn.

**It's much better to see a natural engagement loop** that leverages push notifications and email in a way that's user-initiated.

**Red flags in engagement:**

- **Cohort curves that don't flatten.** Ideally >20% should stick, so each signup activates into a sticky, active user over time. If only 5% of users stick, you'd have to sign up 2 billion users to get 100M MAUs. Not tenable.
- **Artificial engagement.** Notifications that are being manufactured, not organically created. Look at a breakdown of every notification—volume and CTRs over time. Do a spam check on Reddit, Twitter, Google. The right attitude: Notifications accelerate engagement that's already there—you can't make it out of thin air.
- **Users getting logged out and failing password attempts.** Common for 50-75% of signed up users to be inactive. When inactive users come back (notification, etc.) and try to log in, they're locked, can't remember password, become permanently inactive. This is a huge drag. Uber literally sees tens of millions of failed sign-in attempts.

**Frequency of use:** Almost every product has a "ladder of engagement" where you come for one use case, but become stickier and higher frequency by adding use cases.

For Uber, riders often do their first trip for travel use cases (getting to airport)—2 trips/year. Then layer on "going out" (dinners on weekend)—1 trip/week. Eventually other use cases until commuting—2 trips/day.

**The key insight:** Engagement metrics are very hard to move compared to acquisition. It's better to assume the curves are what they are. But if you must add a bullish forecast, focus on new user activation and up-selling users from one frequency segment into the other.
