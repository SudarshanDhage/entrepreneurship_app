# The Law of Shitty Clickthroughs

**After months of iterating on different marketing strategies, you finally find something that works.**

However, the moment you start to scale it, the effectiveness of your marketing grinds to a halt. Sound familiar?

**Welcome to the Law of Shitty Clickthroughs:**

Over time, all marketing strategies result in shitty clickthrough rates.

**The numbers don't lie:**

- HotWired CTR, 1994: **78%**
- Facebook CTR, 2011: **0.05%**

That's a 1500X difference. The clickthrough rates of banner ads, email invites, and many other marketing channels on the web have decayed every year since they were invented.

Email open rates have declined over time. Meanwhile, the number of emails sent out has increased to 30+ billion per day.

**All these channels are decaying over time.** What's saving us? New marketing channels are constantly getting unveiled. These new channels offer high performance because of a lack of competition, big opportunities for novel marketing techniques.

**There are three drivers:**

**1. Customers respond to novelty, which inevitably fades**

When HotWired showed banner ads for the first time in history, people clicked just to check out the experience. Same for being the first web product to email people invites—it works for a while, until your customers get used to the effect and start ignoring it.

**Humans seek novelty yet are pattern-recognition machines.** Your initial marketing strategy will work quite well as your users try it for the first time. Afterwards, they learn to filter your marketing efforts out unless they are genuinely useful.

This is "banner blindness." Eye-tracking studies show users almost comically avoid looking at banners.

**2. First-to-market never lasts**

It's bad enough that your own marketing efforts drive down channel performance. But usually once your marketing efforts are working, your competitors quickly follow.

There's a whole cottage industry providing competitive research on how competitors are advertising. Any clone of your business can quickly fast-follow your marketing efforts and use the same ads in the same marketing channels.

This quickly degrades the performance of the marketing channel as the novelty wears off and clickthroughs plummet.

**Any product that is first to market has a limited window** where they'll enjoy unnaturally high marketing performance, until the competition enters.

**3. More scale means less qualified customers**

Think about the Technology Adoption Lifecycle. Early adopters actively seek out your product, while the mainstream market needs a lot of convincing.

**Early adopters respond better to marketing efforts** across any given metric (signup %, CTR, CPA) than later customer segments. The early market seeks out novelty, whereas the mainstream market just cares if you solve a problem for them.

As a result, a marketing strategy focused on early adopters is bound to look better than what you get later. You can get some limited traffic from PR and targeted advertising from niche communities. However once you get past this group, the CTRs can drop substantially.

**The danger for SaaS/ecommerce companies:** If you've road-tested your marketing strategy by acquiring limited batches of customers, whatever assumptions and projections you make off of this base end up fundamentally skewed positive.

If your model indicates that you can acquire customers at $10 and break even within 6 months, it's not hard for a 30% increase in CAC and 30% decrease in LTV to double the time it takes to get to profitability. **This could be the difference between life and death for a company.**

**How to fight it:**

I call it a Law because I believe it's a strong gravitational pull on all marketing on the web. You can't avoid it, and in many ways, it's counterproductive to try.

**You can always get incrementally better performance** by taking a nomad strategy—always keep developing new creative, testing new publishers. That's all easy, but is mostly about maintaining some base level of performance. This can push the Law to act over years rather than degrading your marketing efforts over months.

**This law provides a litmus test:** The difference between advertising and information. When you are marketing with useful information, then CTRs stay high. Advertising that's just novelty and noise wrapped in a new marketing channel has a limited shelf life.

**The real solution: Discover the next untapped marketing channel**

The 10X solution is to discover the next untapped marketing channel. Work hard to get to the next marketing channel while it's uncontested.

Sometimes I get asked "have you ever seen someone do XYZ to acquire customers?" Turns out, the highest vote of confidence I can give is, **"No I haven't, and that's good—that means there's a higher chance of it working. You should try it."**

Today, these relatively uncontested marketing channels are Open Graph, mobile notifications, etc. If you can make these channels work with a strong product behind it, great. Chances are, you'll enjoy a few months if not a few years of strong marketing performance before they too, slowly succumb.

**The gravitational pull is real. But you can outrun it—momentarily—by getting to the next channel first.**
