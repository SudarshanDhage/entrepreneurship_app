# User Quality and Selection

**When CAC/LTV spreadsheets fail.**

When a new product comes to market, the team measures baseline metrics around lifetime value. If numbers look good, they might say: OK, let's roll out some incentives and get more users like this.

Spreadsheets are built. Budgets are planned. Growth is forecasted. The new growth project kicks off.

**The problem:** These incentives usually end up attracting a different type of marginal user. Negative selection.

**What happens:**
- Core metrics like LTV and engagement can be half as good or lower
- Fraud increases—users create new accounts to grab incentives
- You cannibalize organic growth—pulling forward users you would have gotten anyway

**This creates a related dynamic to the Law of Shitty Clickthroughs.** Not only do individual marketing channels degrade, but many of the new channels you add over time—because they're incentivized—perform worse than the initial channels. The entire machine gets slower and harder as you go.

**Why this matters for web3, gamified apps, etc.:**

If you take a game or app that doesn't have inherent engagement and retention, it's not enough to add gaming mechanics. The new mechanics might make things worse—they attract users who respond to the mechanics but wouldn't otherwise use the underlying product.

We saw this in web3: Incentives attracted speculators early on, but struggled to find fun gameplay to attain actual users. Similarly, gamified consumer apps might attract a type of user who's happy to engage in any gamified app, and who will quickly move on because the underlying app doesn't engage.

**The Uber case study:**

**Rider referrals:** Discount seekers. Performed worse than other channels. Worse than paid ads. Millions of dollars of unnecessary spend.

**Driver referrals:** Highly money motivated. Even though referrals were 15% of sign-ups, they were well over 30% of first trips. Positively selected.

**The key insight:** Incentives are a form of selection. Make sure you know what you're selecting for.

If you're selecting for discount seekers, you'll get discount seekers. If you're selecting for money-motivated drivers who perform well, you'll get that instead.

**Quality of acquisition matters more than quantity.**
