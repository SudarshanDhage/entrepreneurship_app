# The Growth Accounting Framework

Oftentimes you'll find a startup that presents their growth curve—up and to the right. This looks great. Time to invest, right?

**The problem:** You don't know where it's going to go.

In the long run, the curve might plateau. It might collapse. Or it might continue going up, even hockey-sticking.

**How do you predict the future? Is it working and will it sustain? Will it even accelerate?**

The Growth Accounting Framework helps decompose growth into its underlying components.

Within each time period (say a week, or a month):
- You'll add some users (New)
- Reactivate some folks who had previously churned (Reactivated)
- Some go inactive (Inactive)

Add this up and it's the "Net MAU" for a product—the difference between each time period.

**If your positive terms (New+Reactivated) are smaller than your negative terms (the number who become Inactive), then you stop growing, and the whole thing goes negative.**

**The New+Reactivated term** tends to look linear or be an S-curve. The reason: It's really hard to scale acquisition. Only a few things can bring you to millions or tens of millions of users—viral loops, paid marketing, SEO. And as the acquisition channel gets bigger, it tends to get less effective. Ads become more expensive. Viral loops saturate your target market.

**Reactivation tends to be hard to control.** If someone quits your product, emailing them a bunch probably won't help. (But if you have a network, something like photo-tagging or @mentions might.) Most products don't have a network, so acquisition tends to be much bigger than reactivation.

**The Inactive curve** is also an S-curve, but it lags acquisition. Simple reason: Until you have a base of active users, you can't really churn. You can't churn anyone when you have zero users. So it goes up over time.

**At the moment that your New+Reactivated equals your Inactive users each time period, you hit peak MAUs.** This is the thing to watch for, because then it's all flat or down from there.

**The problem with the Growth Accounting Framework:** It provides lagging metrics. It's hard to predict the future. It's like looking at a company's current year P&L—useful, but not enough. It's hard to be predictive. It's also hard to be actionable for product teams.

**That's why you need leading indicators and a more predictive conceptual model.**

Instead of just looking at the accounting, look at two key loops:
- **Acquisition loops**, which power the positive term for New
- **Engagement loops**, which power the negative terms on Reactivation and Inactive

Understanding these underlying loops is the key to predicting where a graph is going to go. Not just charting them out in a spreadsheet, but thinking about the quality of the loops—how defensible and proprietary are they? How scalable and repeatable? Is there upside in optimizing them?

**If we understand the quality of user growth, we can forecast into the future as opposed to looking backwards.**
