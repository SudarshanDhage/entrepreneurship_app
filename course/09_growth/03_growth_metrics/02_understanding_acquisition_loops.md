# Understanding Acquisition Loops

**The key thing to ask for the Acquisition Loop:** Understand how a cohort of new users leads to another set of new users. If you can get that going, then by a conceptual proof by induction, you'll be able to show how it scales.

**Importantly, these loops are flows within the product that are created on top of pre-existing, large platforms.** Sometimes the loops are built because they are bought—via ads. Sometimes they're built via API integrations, to allow for easier/faster sharing. Sometimes it's via a partnership.

**Examples:**

- **UGC SEO-driven loop:** Yelp, Houzz, Reddit, Glassdoor. New users find content through Google, a small % generate more content, which gets indexed by Google, and the loop repeats.
- **Paid marketing loop:** Spend money, sell products, take the money and buy more ads. Keep going.
- **Viral loops:** Users directly or indirectly share a product with friends/colleagues, and the loop repeats itself.

**Loops aren't just conceptual—you can measure their efficiency.** If you can get 1000 users to invite and sign up +600 of their friends, you have a ratio of 0.6. In the first cycle. But then those 600 new users generate 0.6×600=360 new users, who then generate 216, and so on, until the entire cohort is +1500 signups total from a base of 1000.

**That's meaningful** because for every user you get through other means, you're amplifying their effect.

**What about PR, conferences, in-house content marketing?** Yes, they can be useful—but they don't scale. Conferences happen irregularly, have poor ROI/attribution tracking, and every dollar made can't quickly be reinvested. Contrast that to paid marketing, which can be highly accountable, become very optimized, and scale to $1B+ spend/year.

PR, conferences, partnerships are more like one-off opportunities. Use them to drive traffic into your loop, which then gets amplified.

**Red flags in acquisition metrics:**

- **New channels appearing but aren't sustainable.** Especially ad spend that comes and goes, indicating maybe everything's been juiced before the fundraise.
- **A bunch of new users from a new channel that's actually low quality.** Or doubling down on a low-quality channel just to pump up signup numbers.
- **Concentration risk:** If all users come from a beta users list or Product Hunt, that won't scale over time.
- **Platform risk:** If the loop depends on a platform that might change (Instagram, Google SEO), and the platform shrinks or changes policies, you're vulnerable. Remember Branchout—trying to build LinkedIn on top of Facebook Platform. It grew to 14 million DAU, then was 1/10 the size just 4 months later.

**The key:** Understand the quality of acquisition. Low platform risk. Proprietary and repeatable loops. Not just signups, but signups that translate into paying customers or active users.
