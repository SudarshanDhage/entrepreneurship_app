# The Flywheel Effect

**The flywheel effect occurs when small wins accumulate over time, creating momentum that keeps your business growing.**

Once you get a flywheel going, it takes relatively little effort to keep it spinning or to make it spin faster. They'll even keep spinning on their own for a while. **Flywheels attract and engage customers 24 hours a day—they're literally working while you sleep.**

## The Concept

The flywheel model is based on a concept from Jim Collins' classic business book "Good to Great." Put simply, the central idea is that **your customers are your best salespeople.**

If you make them happy, they'll tell their friends. And if you make your product easy to learn about and purchase, those friends will buy it. Then your new happy customers will tell their friends, and so on.

It's a virtuous cycle.

## The Three Components

The flywheel has three major components:

### 1. Attract

Draw prospective customers to you with helpful content that is easy to discover. SEO, social media, targeted advertising, and live/virtual events all have a role to play here. **Focus on earning their attention rather than forcing yourself into their line of sight.**

### 2. Engage

Now that you've made a good impression, make it easy for prospects to learn about your product on their own terms and in their own time, and ultimately buy it. Nurture campaigns, free trials, and a self-serve purchase flow are your best friends in this phase.

### 3. Delight

Design your product to be as easy to get started with as possible. Offer documentation and knowledge bases that help customers get more value out of what you're offering. Solicit customer feedback and act on it. **Your goal here is to turn users into fans, who will recommend your product to their peers, friends, and even to perfect strangers through online reviews and social media.**

## The Key: Reducing Friction

Notice how many times we used the word "easy"? **Reducing friction is key to growing your business with the flywheel model.**

Flywheels (the physical kind used in motors or rowing machines) are incredibly efficient at storing and releasing energy. The faster a flywheel spins, the more energy it stores. And you make it spin faster by removing friction and applying force.

The same holds true for the flywheel business model. Search engine optimization, a "freemium" option, and an ever-improving user experience are among the many forces you can apply to your flywheel. These forces build both momentum and stability for your business.

## Important Caveats

1. **A flywheel business model doesn't work well for products that are custom-built and/or very expensive.**

2. **Making things "easy" for customers at every stage of their lifecycle is a brutally difficult undertaking.**

3. **The journey to achieving the flywheel effect is long and full of difficult trade-offs.** But it's the key to unlocking exponential growth.

## The Ultimate Goal

**Products should be bought, not sold.** As consumers, we do our own research. We don't want to be sold to. We just want to buy the stuff we need and get on with our day.

The flywheel model suits the way people make purchasing decisions now. It's a low-touch, highly automated go-to-market approach that fosters stable growth and frees up investment for R&D—which, in turn, gets that flywheel cranking.
