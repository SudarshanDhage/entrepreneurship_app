# 10 Lessons on Building a Flywheel

**Lessons from a decade of using the flywheel model at Atlassian.**

These are practical, battle-tested insights from Cameron Deatsch, Chief Revenue Officer at Atlassian, where the flywheel model has been central to growing the company to 6,000+ employees and beyond $5 billion in revenue.

## Lesson 1: Just Let Them Buy

**Good products sell themselves. All you need to do is get out of the way.**

Optimize for customer self-service:
- Let people educate themselves about your product through online content
- Get rid of most forms, gates, and other barriers to information
- Post your pricing online
- Make the purchase process as simple and familiar as ordering from Amazon

## Lesson 2: Price for Volume and Consistency

**Entry-level pricing should be low so as to remove friction.** Just get people into the product as quickly as possible.

Atlassian's products can support teams of tens of thousands of people, but they offer most of them free to teams of 10 or fewer. At that point, there doesn't even need to be a conversation. Anyone interested in trying a product can just go ahead and see if it's a good fit.

**Every customer should get the same price no matter what.** Price your product competitively and stand by your price. There are two reasons for this:

1. **Deals and discounts train your customers not to take the information on your website at face value.** It encourages them to delay their purchase in the hopes of getting a better price later.

2. **Negotiating special deals takes your team away from doing the type of work that'll pay dividends over and over.**

## Lesson 3: Treat Human Interaction as a Bug

Don't get me wrong: We love our customers and love talking with them. But the reality is, **anyone who is engaging prospective customers one-on-one isn't using that time to make the products or overall experience better for everyone.**

Every time a 1:1 customer interaction is required to complete a sale, ask why. What information did they need that wasn't provided? Which transaction were they unable to make on their own? **Every customer question is evidence of friction that, wherever possible, should be removed.**

## Lesson 4: Make a Lot of Friends (Part 1)

**An indirect sales channel is critical if you're a B2B company trying to grow a global customer base.**

By building a global network of channel partners who know the lay of the land, you can avoid establishing your own footprint in every region. Plus, partners can provide the kind of industry-specific expertise you need to efficiently expand into new target markets, particularly complex ones such as government or regulated industries.

Atlassian invested in a sales channel program early on that they continue to nurture and that now accounts for a third of their revenue.

**Integration partnerships** also make both products stickier and help expand your customer base. For example, users can request access to Confluence directly from a Slack channel when a teammate shares the link to a Confluence page.

## Lesson 5: Apply Diverse Forces for Greater Expansion

**The more types of force you apply to your flywheel, the more customers you'll attract.**

A B2C company might apply forces like spinoff products, loyalty programs, or influencer marketing. New products or editions of existing products are also well suited for B2B companies, as are technical services and an ecosystem of add-ons.

**Building an ecosystem is especially effective because it operates as its own flywheel.** The more apps for your product, the more use cases you can satisfy. That increases demand both for your products and for apps.

Atlassian has found that a customer that adds at least one app to a product is far less likely to churn out, and more likely to add more Atlassian products, massively expanding the lifetime value of that customer.

## Lesson 6: Make a Lot of Friends (Part 2)

**Providing an online forum for users to ask questions and exchange tips is a low-cost way to keep people engaged.**

For example, Atlassian's Community program has evolved to include a website containing a user-generated knowledge base, discussion threads, articles, and even user-led events. It's like the best parts of StackOverflow, Reddit, Medium, and MeetUp all under one umbrella.

Behind all this is a small team whose main objective is to turn users into fans. They recognize and reward the most active, helpful community members. They also recruit "Community Champions" who organize live and virtual events. The Community team then supports Champions with ready-made agendas and presentation materials.

## Lesson 7: Don't Fall Into the Enterprise Trap

When early-stage B2B companies start landing bigger customers, people tend to get excited. They prioritize those larger deals while ignoring smaller customers, even to the point of letting big customers dictate licensing terms and product roadmaps. **This is both logical and tempting. It's also a trap.**

**The price you pay for focusing on big contracts to the exclusion of small customers is the loss of volume.** And without low-friction volume, your flywheel will grind to a halt before it has a chance to really get cranking.

Not to mention that once you start letting a handful of customers tell you what to build—regardless of whether the rest of your customers want those features—you'll never get out of that mode.

**Be patient. Stick to your model, and be willing to forego the customers who don't respect it. They're likely to be more trouble than they're worth.**

## Lesson 8: Think Global, Beware of Local

A U.S. company wants to enter, say, the German market. But the content and tone on their website don't really resonate with the German audience. So they build separate web content for Germany. And Germans aren't as comfortable with this whole self-service purchasing thing, so these new German web pages include an invitation to get in touch with their sales team—who they now have to go out and hire. A few rounds of this in a few different countries, and oops: **their flywheel is fundamentally broken.**

To go high-volume, you almost have to go global. You also have to avoid re-creating a bespoke version of your entire GTM game in each market you go after. Start with the basics, like localizing your website so customers can learn about your product in their native language. You might be surprised how far that gets you.

## Lesson 9: Remember That Active Users Trump Everything Else

**Usage is the best indicator of your company's future.** It doesn't matter how much you *sell*. What matters is whether people are *using* your product. If they are, they're getting value out of it. And if your product is "sticky," you can charge for it.

Bonus points if you can create a subscription option, which both reduces friction for customers and stabilizes your revenue stream. From there, you can expand your relationship with customers through additional users, premium editions of your product, and/or additional products.

So even if you have to get people in the door with a freemium model, that's OK. You can gradually monetize over time. **The trick is not to set the expectation that all things will be free forever.**

## Lesson 10: Reinforce Your Flywheel with Company Values That Actually Matter

**None of this will work unless you have a cohesive team with shared values and a shared understanding of the company's big goals.** That's what keeps you grounded as you grow.

When Cameron joined Atlassian almost 10 years ago, they operated like a start-up. That is *not* the case anymore. They've grown into a sophisticated enterprise with 6,000+ employees, offices on four continents, and the ambition to grow beyond $5 billion in revenue.

**Culture changes, but values don't.** They keep the company focused on working as a positive force in customers' lives through every feature they ship, every product they launch, and every dollar they invest.

## The Results

By delivering products customers rave about, Atlassian has been able to build a flywheel powered by word of mouth and amplified by data-driven touchpoints that help customers make purchase decisions at their own pace. **This hyper-efficient GTM machine runs on just 15% of revenue, allowing them to invest more in product improvements that delight customers—and the virtuous cycle continues.**

The journey to achieving the flywheel effect is long and full of difficult trade-offs. But it's the key to unlocking exponential growth.
