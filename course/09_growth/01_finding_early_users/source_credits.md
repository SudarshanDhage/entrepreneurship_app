- **Key Concepts:** Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), targeting, positioning, marketing messaging, customer segmentation. Key insight: "Selling to everyone means selling to no one." Targeting your ICP (Carol) actually brings 10x more customers than you expected because clear messaging attracts people with similar purchasing preferences (Diana, 10x larger) and those who weigh trade-offs in your favor (Eddie, 20x-100x larger). When you target Carol, your positioning is strongest, and you win where you deserve to win. But far more people will buy because they have similar purchasing preferences. Examples: Subaru targeting lesbians in the '90s (risky at the time) led to fastest growth of any car company, with majority of buyers being straight. Need to identify Carols, prioritize them over revenue, ignore noise from non-ICP customers. This separates first-time founders from seasoned founders.

- **Key Concepts:** Market segmentation, mid-market targeting, B2B sales, market selection. Key insight: "Mid-sized companies: Small enough to have small budgets, big enough for bureaucratic nightmares." The mid-market is the worst of both worlds—startup graveyards are littered with companies who tried to target this segment. They have arduous sales processes like big companies but small budgets like small companies. You have to sell 30 mid-sized companies for every large one to get the same revenue. "Mid-sized companies" isn't really a market segment anyway—industry and problems matter more than size. Common misconception: "Small businesses have no money, and large companies use entrenched competitors, so opportunity is in the middle." But there isn't necessarily an opportunity—maybe competitors figured out it's not cost-effective. WP Engine example: initially tried mid-market, then optimized around choosing one or the other. Only expand to mid-market when you can spend tens of millions on proper infrastructure. Focus on small companies OR large companies—pick one.
