# The Incentive Trap

**The people you attract with referral programs, free trials, coupons, and gamification are usually MUCH WORSE than organic ones.**

Worse LTVs. Worse conversion. Less engaged.

Andrew Chen learned this the hard way. He headed up Uber's $300m+/year referral program ("give $5 and get $5"). Millions of dollars of spend that didn't need to happen.

**Why are these users worse?**

**Negative selection.** All these forms of incentives attract a different type of marginal user—one that wouldn't have signed up earlier. They're less qualified. More discount seeking. They behave differently.

This is especially true when the product has been out there for a while and the core market has mostly been saturated. You also see significant amounts of fraud. Users create new accounts to grab incentives. It can be simple—or much more organized and nefarious.

**The math breaks down.** Core metrics like LTV and engagement can often be half as good or lower. That's enough to defeat the mathematics that justified the program in the first place. An additional user at upside-down mechanics feels good from a top-line basis, but fewer users would be better for the business model.

**Cannibalization.** This one's subtle but important. You have a target market, and sometimes it takes time for a product to spread through its ideal users. Word of mouth is free. When it happens organically, the intent is higher.

But if these ideal users encounter the product via an incentive program, you often "pull forward" these users—costing you money when you would have gotten them anyway.

**The Uber story:** Not only did the rider-side referral programs perform worse over time, and worse than other channels—the users were much worse than even users bought from paid ads.

**But here's the twist:** The referral program on the driver side attracted very positively selected users. Whereas rider referrals got discount seekers, the drivers were highly money motivated. Even though referrals were 15% of sign-ups, they were well over 30% of first trips.

**The lesson:** Incentives are a form of selection. You need to make sure you know what you're selecting for.
