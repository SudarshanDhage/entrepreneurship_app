# Where to Find Early Adopters

Practical tactics from founders who've been there. Finding your first users should be your #1 priority—you should not have time for anything else but this.

## Online Communities

### Reddit
- Post to relevant subreddits where your target audience hangs out
- Key: Don't try to sell—be honest that you've been working on a project and ask for feedback
- Some subreddits allow self-promotion; read the rules carefully
- Provide value first: Answer questions in the subreddit, only mention your product if someone is complaining about the pain point you solve
- Don't post links; let people Google you (helps with SEO too)

**Strategy:** Find your biggest "competitor"—ideally a community that hacks an existing product to do what your project does. People who are already spending their time and money to solve the problem your product addresses.

### Hacker News
- Post Show HN for tech products
- Timing matters: Pacific time zone seems to be key
- It's often luck of the draw—many posts don't get attention
- Don't expect magic, but it can work if you catch the right moment
- Be prepared: People will ask about self-hosting, source code, licensing, etc.

### IndieHackers
- Write an article that gets traction
- Productivity tools go down fairly well there
- Users don't enjoy people who are *only* there to sell—participate a little first

### Twitter/X
- Tweet out screenshots of private beta
- Write short blog posts about related topics and tweet those out
- Cross-promote from blog to product
- You'll need 1000+ people to hit your site to get 100 beta users

### Product Hunt
- Can get some traction, especially if posted right at midnight
- However, it's heavily gamed—expect limited results unless you have influencer friends
- Don't expect to top the daily leaderboard without help

## Paid Acquisition

### LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms
- Highly targeted advertisements
- Include in the ad that you're looking for beta test users and specify what kind
- About $25–$50 per meeting
- Very personal and transparent—there are bored professionals who love trying apps and giving feedback
- Works best for B2B SaaS

### Facebook Ads
- Good audience for tech early adopters
- But you have to put up with a lot of garbage leads
- Lower ROI than LinkedIn for B2B

### Offering Discounts or Free Access
- Early adopters could mean "first customers at a super low price"
- Less people want to try something untried, but people want to try something super cheap they actually need
- Offer lifetime free license for first 100 sign-ups who start using it
- This means product has to be at least partially viable

## In-Person Strategies

### Conferences and Meetups
- Find high-density gatherings of potential early users
- Hanging out in niche co-working spaces (e.g., digital nomad spaces)
- Sponsor professional mixer events—might get a 5-minute speaking spot for a few hundred bucks

### Personal Network
- Call up buddies from previous jobs (for B2B)
- Spend political capital on friends for first few users
- Snowball interviewing: Start with few productivity-obsessed people you know, ask them "who should I chat for 15 mins to get feedback"
- Craft the ask well so it doesn't come off as demanding
- Give value at every interaction

## Content Marketing

### Blog Posts and SEO
- Write content for your (potential) audience
- Create content aggregators about topics related to your project
- Gains SEO and traffic
- Finds users to sign up to newsletters and updates

### YouTube
- Make videos about your niche
- Post a video asking viewers to participate

## Platforms and Marketplaces

### App Stores (iOS, Android, Mac App Store)
- Post MVP to app stores
- Can get surprising geographic reach
- One founder had a sale the next day from thousands of miles away

### Google Workspace Marketplace / Similar Platforms
- Many individuals regularly browse such websites
- The market looks "ready-made"
- Mobile apps stores work similarly

## Creative Tactics

### WiFi Hotspot Name
- Set your hotspot name to your project's domain name
- When around techies or on long train trips
- No idea if it actually works, but it's free and creative

### Directory Listings
- Find any and all directories that might list products like yours
- Betalist, SideProjectors, etc.

### Side Projects as Marketing
- Build little free tools that your audience might use
- Gets you noticed and builds trust

## The Snowball Method

Once you have early users:
- Ask them who else should you talk to
- Offer to extend trials if they find friends/colleagues interested
- Build a flywheel effect—if it works, you know you're onto something
- Build a user acquisition team of volunteers who can approach target customers one-to-one

## Key Principles

1. **Figure out where your users are** - Where do they congregate online or offline?
2. **Join active discussions** - Where they're already talking about related problems
3. **Provide value first** - Don't just show up to sell
4. **Be personal and transparent** - Especially when asking for beta testers
5. **Understand the culture** - Each community has different norms
6. **Focus on discussion, not just exposure** - Making it to front page isn't enough if there's no discussion

## Resources

- **The Mom Test** - Book about having early conversations with customers
- **Traction** (Gabriel Weinberg & Justin Mares) - Framework with finite list of strategies you can prioritize and execute
- **First1000.co** - Documents how several startups got their first customers
