# Talk to Customers Before Building

**"Why are you building something if you haven't talked to your customers?"**

This question from YC Startup School cuts to the heart of a fundamental mistake many founders make: building in isolation, hoping users will come later.

## The Core Problem

Many founders spend months building a solution to a problem they *think* needs solving, then seek users to pay for it. **All of those attempts rarely result in success.**

The better approach: Talk to people and listen to what they need. See an opportunity in what they're asking for, then start building while letting them use it as soon as it's even a tiny bit functional. **Only invest your time building when there's a positive signal that people would pay for it.**

## Common Objections (And Why They're Wrong)

### "It's a secret and I don't want competitors to get an advantage"

If it's that easy to replicate, what's to stop them from copying you and eating your market share once you've launched? 

**Talk to customers about their problems and their needs, not the solution itself.** The solution can remain a secret.

### "Customers won't get the idea without an MVP"

If that's true, then you have to ask yourself if you're actually solving a problem people have or designing a solution in search of a problem. Which then comes back to the advice about speaking to your customers.

Again, **figure out the customers' problems first.**

### "Revealing my idea might reduce my impulse"

This is possible, but often the reverse happens: engineers spend forever refining their idea because they're scared to release anything until it's perfect. At least by revealing your idea, you're committing to a release-early-and-often model.

### "Customers will ask for all kinds of features and change my idea"

If customers are asking for features, then there's your demand right there. Strategize on how you want to address it.

The opposite of that problem is spending months building something users don't want nor need—which again comes back to speaking to your customers.

## The Hard Truth

**The moment you try to go to market is when you realize that your IPO is probably not happening any time soon.**

If you don't listen to people, you'll need to be very lucky with loyal supporters, or a very rare visionary with incredible talent and commitment.

## The Right Approach

1. **Talk to people about their problems** - Not your solution, their problems
2. **Listen for opportunities** - What are they actually asking for?
3. **Build incrementally** - Let them use it as soon as it's even a tiny bit functional
4. **Look for positive signals** - Only invest more time when there's evidence people will pay

People generally won't or don't reveal their deep pains and needs until you probe and engage in direct research through conversation.

**If you're solving a problem you have yourself, that's a good start—but don't expect anyone else to have the same problem unless you've checked.**
