# True Fans vs Too Good Friends

At the beginning of your journey, it's better to have **10 true fans than 100 unengaged customers/users.**

And keep in mind: your friends will play the "fan" role with great pleasure. They're your friends. They'll tell you what you're doing is "cool"—which most of the time doesn't bode well.

**True fans:**
- Talk about you to friends, family, at parties—people who didn't know you before
- Defend you when you're attacked
- Create the strongest brands through unconditional love

Look at FEMPO or Shanty Biscuits communities in Instagram comments. You'll understand.

**How do you achieve that?**

Get your hands dirty. Spend time with these people. Understand them. Create strong relationships. Really love them honestly. Do everything to solve their problem with the highest level of care in your service.

**Example:** Lady Gaga created a strong iconographic universe (costumes) and smart community identity ("My Little Monsters ❤"). At the beginning, she interacted on a daily basis with **ALL** her fans.

That's how you build real communities. Not with friends telling you it's cool. With true fans who'll defend you and spread the word.
