- **Key Concepts:** Small teams, deadlines, promises, communication, ownership, hierarchy, commitments, mistakes, resources, relationships
- **Key Insight:** A concise manifesto with 20 principles for small teams doing important work. Core themes: Time is most valuable asset—always under tight deadlines. Promises and dates: set dates for promises, meet them, communicate early if you can't. Ownership: clean up your own mess and others' messes. Communication: overcommunicate; question premises/strategy but not goodwill/effort/intent. Professionalism: "I'll know it when I see it" is not professional—describe and discuss in abstract. Priorities: big projects less important than scary commitments; if your work doesn't matter to mission, help others. Learning: make mistakes, own them, fix them, share learning. Tools: cheap, reliable, public software usually better. Hierarchy: yesterday's hierarchy less important than today's project structure. Flexibility: lock in what must be locked in, leave implementation loose. Reality: we do things that haven't been done before—don't be surprised when surprised. Caring: care more. Outsourcing: if outsider can do it faster/cheaper, don't hesitate; always seek outside resources. Relationships: talk to everyone the same way (boss, customer, founder, employee). Personal: it works because it's personal.

## How to Work Faster in a Remote Team

- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Remote work, productivity, distributed teams, communication tools, remote team practices, time management, work environment, asynchronous work, meeting efficiency
- **Key Insight:** Practical guide based on real experiences from remote-first companies. Fundamental difference: Non-remote work defaults to highest distraction communication (in-person), remote work defaults to lowest (no communication). Fewer distractions lead to faster work - you have to purposely decide to enter more distracting conversations. Remote work succeeds in environments with little red tape and low barrier to decision making. Eight ways to work faster: (1) Pull internal communication out of inbox - only two types of internal emails at Zapier (interview feedback, new hire announcements). Move updates/specs/mock-ups to internal blog, feedback/discussions to Slack. Communication feels cheap but adds up to lots of time costs. Streamlining and cutting back-and-forth is true benefit. (2) Rely on right tools - when team lands on right tools, get in groove. Master communication tools (Google Docs, Trello, Slack, Flowdock, video chat). Twilio example: more efficient than in-person because mastery over tools, writing-review-revision feedback loop inherently asynchronous. If one tool doesn't work, move to next. (3) Use differing schedules to advantage - flexible hours for peak productivity (overcome natural lulls with naps/workouts), work when most productive, 24/7 development with time zones (customers get help any hour, production never stops), handoff advantage (end of day in one timezone = start of next day marked up in another). (4) Skip commute - save dozens of hours weekly, zero friction between working and not, apply same principle (prepare lunch, use thermos, cut excess processes). (5) Cancel meetings - video conference annoyance helps you avoid them. Ask: do we really need that meeting? Earn back dozens of hours monthly (one org identified 7,000 hours saved). Example: iDoneThis reconfigured unfocused weekly meetings to show-and-tell sessions. (6) Think before you speak (send) - written communication forces thought, extra steps add filter, clearer/more concise communication. Amazon approach: ban PowerPoint, require memos (full sentences harder to write, force clear thinking). Chat is more to the point, skips chit-chat. (7) Set up best environment - Jason Fried insight: people rarely say "the office" when asked where they get things done. Office shreds day into work moments (15 min here, 30 min there). Remote: control environment (quiet home), change surroundings quickly (stand/sit/couch), work from anywhere (mall/coffee shop/park bench). First telecommuting experience: finishing tasks much earlier, working better in environment. (8) Own up to productivity - responsible for productivity, must own what you did/didn't accomplish. Example: Belle Cooper cut blog post time from 2 days to 4 hours by examining what held her up (cut excess research, distractions). Practical tip: Trello board for to-dos, automation for weekly recaps (cut from 40 to 20 min). Downsides: time zone delays (waiting for responses from people asleep), lone remote member challenges (harder to communicate via whiteboards), infrastructure issues (shoddy internet). Key insight: might not need to go fully remote - instant messaging apps, collaborative editing, file sharing already shift how we communicate. Even companies that don't allow remote work encourage it implicitly through equipment and habits. Personal tip: completely unplug from communication tools, put 100% focus in distraction-free environment.

## Remote Work Emergency Plan: What to Do (and Where to Start)

- **Source:** GitLab Handbook
- **Author:** GitLab (primarily Darren Murph, Head of Remote)
- **URL:** https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture//all-remote/remote-work-emergency-plan/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Remote work, emergency transition, work-from-home, remote leadership, handbook, communications plan, tool stack, change management, forced remote work, crisis management
- **Key Insight:** Practical guide for leaders who suddenly find themselves managing work-from-home teams. Critical distinction: It is neither remote work nor an experiment. Being forced to work from home during a pandemic restricts all but a handful of remote work benefits. The heart of remote work (freedom to choose where you work, ability to weave life into work schedule, opportunity to optimize life for something other than proximity to office) remains squashed. Leaders must untangle "remote work" from "crisis-induced work-from-home" and help workers visualize liberating remote future vs isolating forced work-from-home. Five focus areas: (1) Establish Remote Leadership Team - shift triggers shockwave of change, evaluate managers, rally experts with remote experience who can communicate nuances, document challenges in real time, transparently prioritize, assign DRIs. Executive assistants may take on more significant role as documentarians and aiding internal communications. (2) Establish handbook - start rudimentary, single source of truth, communicate company-wide, update continually with DRIs for common questions. Can start as webpage or repository in Notion, serves well after crisis. Biggest challenge: keeping everyone informed efficiently. Systematically document process changes in central place to minimize confusion. Working remotely requires writing things down - for companies without documentation culture, this is most difficult shift. (3) Establish communications plan - depending on team size, consider always-on video conference room per team where members can linger or come/go. Simulation helps acclimation, shows intentionality around informal communication (spontaneous in office, needs immediate replacement remotely). Transparency vital - leaders shouldn't hold back, maintain perspective, everyone reacts differently, not all homes ideal workspaces, feels jarring, team expects frequent updates. Funnel communication into as few places as possible to reduce silos/fragmentation, proactively solve mass confusion finding things (policies, protocols, messaging). (4) Minimize tool stack - strip down to minimum: Google Docs, company-wide chat (Teams/Slack), Zoom. If VPN needed, ensure easy access with clear instructions. Companies without documentation culture will find this most difficult shift. (5) Drive change - humans naturally resistant to change, especially forced during uncertainty/crisis. Leaders must meet reality head-on. All-hands approach to recognizing new reality advised, vital to empowering everyone to contribute. For companies with strong in-office experience: remote transition is process not binary switch. Leaders responsible for embracing iteration, being open about what works/doesn't, messaging to all employees. Core: managing remote company like any company - trust, communication, company-wide support of shared goals. Additional resources available: pitfalls, phases of adaptation, transitioning company, forcing functions, combating burnout/isolation/anxiety, self-service mindset. GitLab expertise: one of world's largest all-remote companies, 100% remote with no offices, 1,500+ team members in 65+ countries, Head of Remote has 15+ years experience. "How to Manage a Remote Team" course on Coursera - free with optional $49 certificate, covers leading remotely, building remote culture/practices, assessing readiness, creating transformation strategy, final project creates strategic plan for remote transition. Intermediate-level, requires 1+ year management experience, no remote experience required.

## A Guide to Distributed Teams

- **Source:** Increment Magazine (Stripe)
- **Author:** Juan Pablo Buriticá (VP of Engineering at Splice) and Katie Womersley (VP of Engineering at Buffer)
- **URL:** https://increment.com/teams/a-guide-to-distributed-teams/
- **Date:** November 2019 (Issue 11: Teams)
- **Key Concepts:** Distributed teams, remote work, communication, coordination, collaboration, organization, operations, culture, time zones, synchronous vs asynchronous, cross-functional teams, remote hiring, onboarding
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive guide to building effective distributed teams. Core principle: All teams past certain size become distributed. Effective distributed team is effective team - evaluate same way. What makes distributed different is intention and advanced planning - doesn't happen by accident, requires deliberate systems around communication, coordination, collaboration, organization, operations, culture. Six key areas: (1) Communication - default state is miscommunication. Assume someone missed message, repeat yourself, drop passive-aggressive tone. Neutral tones read negative, positive as neutral - overcorrect with emoji/GIFs/explicit communication. Skip sarcasm/irony. Synchronous vs asynchronous: synchronous for real-time exchange, bonds teams, vital for creative ideation, easier to spot problems. Don't let be ad hoc - get teams on cadence. Asynchronous reduces meetings, allows deep work, makes information distribution clear/reliable, scales better. Default to asynchronous for nonblocking items. (2) Coordination - time impacts everything. Harder to react quickly, mitigate with predictability. Establish tempo everyone can predict. Time zone strategies: hybrid (constrained range, Splice example - US Eastern to Pacific), fully distributed (Buffer - 15 hour spread, try to keep teams to 8 hours or less). "Pass the baton" - hand over work across time zones, avoids silos, keeps morale high. Challenges: affects meals, people left out or asked to accommodate. Need at least 2 hours overlap during regular working time. Hybrid needs active management to prevent co-located teams dominating scheduling. (3) Collaboration - not better than co-located, just different. Physically constrained means strategic changes need higher value threshold - many OSS projects successful with this. Glue work (whatever makes org successful - strategy, meetings, PM, design review, mentoring, coaching) - reward explicitly in promotion processes. Important for reducing gender wage gap (women carry burden in collaborative cultures). Face-to-face still critical - meet every 6 months, more than 2 days overwhelming. Plan like mini-conferences. Budget as recurring line item. As team grows, may yield diminishing returns. Collaboration is art and science - observe what works, adjust. (4) Organization - Brooks's law hits earlier. Keep teams small (3-4 engineers to 1 PM works well, 6-7+ becomes difficult). Cross-functional teams own customer-facing outcome, reduce interdependencies, decisions made close to problem. Resist adding every function - embed by having representatives. Working groups organized by function (informal discussion or formalized with specific task) counteract loss of domain expertise/standardization. In orgs 30+ people, delivery team (SREs, FREs, QREs) can own "delivering software" - clear roadblocks, support getting work out door. Embrace overlap between roles - encourage constructive feedback across teams. (5) Operations - bridge strategy with execution. Equipment: minimum is laptop, headphones, decent internet. Buffer reimburses basics plus fast home internet/coworking, new laptops on join, replace after 3 years. Splice offers home-office improvement stipend (peripherals, plants), ships monitor/laptop preference, office-chair stipend. Hiring remotely: mirror how you'll work (video calls not in-person). Pay attention to clarity of written communication, responsiveness, punctuality, communication about delays. Ask about independent work, initiative, growth mindset, unblocking themselves. Better predictors than "worked remotely before." Technical exercises with clear rubrics, evaluate mindful communication too. Onboarding: detailed 30/60/90 day plans, check in at each mark, give buddies. Without this, new people band together leading to misinformation/culture fragmentation. Distributed decision-making: adopt RFC process (Rust/Ember style) - space for proposals, not seeking consensus. (6) Culture - don't try to fulfill utopian expectations. Experiences will be different - that's okay. Not everyone thrives remotely - extroverts can feel lonely/isolated, anxiety/depression more common, flexibility can mean loss of structure, freedom can feel like abandonment. Traffic light check-ins (red/yellow/green) at start/end of meetings - quick way to see how people doing, helps humans support each other. Reinforce culture constantly or become network of freelancers. Stated values essential - can't rely on office vibe. Hybrid: distributed portion lives company like TV show, leaders should work remotely to build empathy. Global company culture can transcend local norms. Lavish public praise for values-aligned behavior, swift/firm discouraging what's not. Work-life boundaries: remote workers work longer (sometimes full extra day/week). Manager concern isn't if working but if they ever stop. Model healthy boundaries, turn off chat, take vacation offline, don't develop "always-on" norm. Benefits: distribute opportunity globally, cultural diversity enriches, autonomy/flexibility, scale faster/cheaper, pop geographic bubbles. Downsides: less IRL time, tendency to hermit (schedule out-of-home activities), FOMO. Final: be explicit about constraints and trade-offs, decisions are yours to make, org will evolve.

## Scaling Engineering Teams via RFCs: Writing Things Down

- **Source:** The Pragmatic Engineer Blog
- **Author:** Gergely Orosz (Author of The Software Engineer's Guidebook; previously at Uber, Microsoft, Skype, Skyscanner)
- **URL:** https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/scaling-engineering-teams-via-writing-things-down-rfcs/
- **Date:** 2025, last updated September 21, 2022
- **Key Concepts:** RFCs, Request for Comments, scaling engineering teams, documentation, engineering planning, architecture, knowledge sharing, transparency, engineering culture, design docs, ADRs
- **Key Insight:** Simple five-step RFC process that scales engineering teams from tens to thousands of engineers, successfully used at Uber and other large tech companies. Addresses two common planning issues: (1) lack of visibility on others building same thing, (2) tech/architecture debt from different teams building differently. Five steps: (1) Do planning before building - whiteboarding or talking through with team, be clear on how to get things done. (2) Capture plan in short written document - once clear to team, should be quick to write down "how", don't go overboard. (3) Have select people approve before starting - similar to PR reviews, have relevant people (senior engineers, users) validate planned work. (4) Send planning document to all engineers in company and let anyone comment - yes, sounds crazy but works. (5) Have everyone follow steps for every project beyond trivial complexity, iterate on lightweight RFC-like process. Process works and scales well, addresses visibility, reduces tech/architecture debt, spreads knowledge, engages engineers. Power of writing things down: creates accountability, leads to more thorough decisions. Examples: code review in writing increases quality, written agenda makes meetings less wasteful, writing down plans reduces surprises. Efficiency argument flipped: if everyone agrees, writing should be easy (few hours). Reality: usually less straightforward - reveals issues: "This is not what I meant", "What about this edge case?", "If we change this, could break that part" - great to have these discussions before project halfway done. Reviewers and spreading knowledge: writing for others different from organizing thoughts, specify who needs to read/give thumbs-up, require confirmation in writing. Sending to everyone: sounds crazy, creates noise (manageable with email filters), less plans sent than expected even with hundreds/thousands engineers. Cultural impact: type of information pushed shapes culture - pushing plans to everyone and inviting comments sets tone of trust/responsibility. Personal experience: reading planning docs from variety of teams learned more about other teams' work in months than years at large company without visibility. Self-balancing/correction: allowing anyone to chime in keeps consistent engineering bar - teams on one side realize other side doing similar with different approach/quality bar. Example: US team building feature without considering other parts of world, India team points out localization gaps. Transparency enables self-balancing/correction naturally. Tailoring via iteration: process refined as company grew - started as email to every engineer, changed to mailing lists per domain (backend, mobile, web), templates built by engineers, more tooling for thousands of engineers. Template evolution: reviewers had same questions ("What is motivation?", "How will this be tested?", "Will architecture changes be made?"), engineers created templates that keep being updated. Backend template: approvers, abstract, architecture changes, service SLAs, service dependencies, load/performance testing, multi data-center concerns, security, testing/rollout, metrics/monitoring, customer support. Mobile/Web template: approvers, abstract, UI/UX, architecture changes, network interactions, library dependencies, security, testing/rollout, analytics, customer support, accessibility. Key: iterate/customize to team needs - templates include what they care about (reliability, scale, security). At Uber: many smaller services so load/performance testing/SLAs important. When accessibility became focus for mobile, section added. Process scales: called RFC (Request for Comments) - similarities with RFC publication process in tech community. Stuck because started early (when team small), helped scale knowledge/eliminate silos, scaled from tens to low thousands. New challenges at few thousand engineers (good problem). Real-world example: BaseUI open source project shows RFC process - all RFCs published/reviewed publicly, development only starts after RFC approved. Not unique to Uber: Google (design docs), Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon all have similar RFC processes. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) also good format. Scale/thoroughness/who docs pushed to/strictness/standardization differs by company. Key takeaway: if planning still adhoc, having RFC process in place early on helps engineering scale greatly. Just try and iterate - that's how it always starts.

## Scaling Engineering Organizations

- **Source:** Stripe Atlas Guides
- **Author:** Raylene Yung (Led efforts to expand Stripe globally, bringing product and engineering teams to new markets; previously engineering director at Facebook; BS and MS in computer science from Stanford)
- **URL:** https://stripe.com/in/guides/atlas/scaling-eng
- **Date:** Published on Stripe Atlas Guides
- **Key Concepts:** Scaling engineering teams, recruiting, hiring, training, onboarding, engagement, retention, candidate experience, rubrics, bias training, psychological safety, employee feedback, hackathons, rotations
- **Key Insight:** Lessons learned from scaling Stripe's engineering team. Core philosophy: deliberate choice to add engineers at slower rate than user base growth, take iterative approach to recruiting and developing team. Keep teams small, invest more in each person, nimbly change ways of working. Built culture of feedback and iterative thinking - what works for 50 engineers may not work for 10 or 1000. Three main areas: (1) Recruiting and Hiring - Continuously evolve process (run well for 6-9 months, then update). Build consistent recruiting platform - increases efficiency, prevents bias, raises hiring bar. Run regular training sessions for new hiring managers, clear documentation for small details. Interview design from industry studies/best practices - understand how people approach real-world problems, not esoteric whiteboard skills. Bug Squash: side-by-side solve real historical bug in open-source project, candidate's language choice. Team Role Plays for managers: simulate one-on-one conversations. Standardize questions using written rubrics - define how to run interview, evaluate consistently, compare scores. Rubric example: Communication skills with 1-4 scale (poor, needs improvement, good, exceptional). Integrate rubrics into applicant tracking system. Unconscious bias training. Candidate Review process: recurring meeting with experienced reviewers to examine all interview results, give feedback to interviewers, identify improvements. Raylene attended every session for 6 months initially - engineers appreciated knowing someone reading notes, quality/consistency improved. Define clear hiring goals - avoid passive funnel, hire who you need. Stripe evolution: early years hired generalist engineers, later needed specialists (infrastructure, frontend, international mobile, secure credential storage). Frontend example: candidates said "Stripe doesn't need frontend engineers - you're API company." Raylene showed live demos of web/mobile dashboards, candidate immediately engaged, joined. Designed structured candidate experience for frontend. Start small (infrastructure, frontend), retool one at a time. Now hire across many pipelines (Android, ML, security). Each detail affects recruiting process: job descriptions, recruiter staffing, specialized interview questions/rubrics/prep guides. Create great candidate experience - interview defines first impression. Benchmark: 12-20% acceptance rate from onsite to offer. For every hire, 4-7 people go elsewhere - they represent your company. Likely to hire from candidates' networks - great impression generates referrals. Best practices: written guides before interview, engineers choose language/use own laptop, follow-up anonymous surveys, speak with every candidate, calls for those who don't accept, personalized feedback when no offer. Results: without offers rate 4.1/5, with offers 4.5/5. Candidates who don't join often refer others. (2) Training and Onboarding - Early mistake: not investing enough, sink-or-swim experience, teammates thought it was "test" to evaluate again. Today invest significant time/energy. First months critical - tempting to ask engineer to build feature first week, but investing in onboarding makes happier/more productive. Stripe 101: general onboarding for all employees, connects new hires across company. Few weeks: classes, meet cofounders, build Stripe integration, answer support tickets, collaborate across functions. Scale: 30 sessions, 82 instructors, 200+ employees last year. Results: 100% summarize 3+ Stripe products, 94.5% positive first week/effective use of time, 90% understand Stripe stack. New hires graduate with immediate network across functions - helps navigate organization. /dev/start: engineering-specific onboarding. New engineers anxious to spend time with technical teams, dive into code. Solve practical problem in main application codebase. Small pilot: handful engineers, volunteer mentors, projects from backlogs, one-on-one feedback. Expanded to all engineering. Today: group into temporary virtual teams for 3-4 weeks, dedicated mentor, learn development process while shipping concrete tool/product improvement. Mentors gain project leadership/mentorship experience - sit with team, break down tasks, answer technical/product questions, review code, bridge to rest of engineering. Don't forget soft skills/culture - psychological safety (Google Project Aristotle: most important factor). Write guides to culture/group norms - general communication and team-specific. "Communicating at Stripe" class: mailing lists, email/bug tracker best practices, non-obvious patterns like scheduling meetings. Calendar norms carry cultural knowledge. Example: Email at Stripe - non-urgent use email, quick response use Slack, OOO autoresponder, send shipped@ email, don't lurk unnecessarily, safe environment for open communication. Engineering teams provide specialized guides for tools (GitHub, JIRA) or practices (code review) - source of truth, collaborative agreement, reduce debate/confusion. Self-serve documentation decreases reliance on oral tradition, scales faster. (3) Engagement and Retention - Invest in team you have. Employee happiness: know impact of work, feel autonomy in decisions. Successful teams: provide structure for long-term engagement, actively listen to feedback, define clear paths for growth, train leaders. Companies can focus short-term output OR long-term productivity. High-growth: conditions change rapidly, early decisions have lasting impact, early employees carry disproportionate knowledge, most effective, greatest mentors, but can feel overloaded/trapped. Collaborate with early employees to build right supporting structure. Don't mistake productivity for engagement - "surprise resignation" story: long-tenured engineer consistently delivering high-quality work, challenging projects, mentoring, quietly resigned at one-on-one. No longer felt challenged - couldn't see way to increase impact and learn new skills. Stuck in local maximum - easier to leave for exciting opportunity than less-impactful internal role. Realization: simple conversation about career aspirations would have revealed concern. People stay engaged when feel personal sense of growth - look beyond day-to-day productivity, ask right questions. StripeSat survey twice yearly: opportunities to learn/grow, see yourself at Stripe in 3 years, good career opportunities (stretch assignments, responsibility, internal mobility). Create supported paths for mobility/learning - help people discover opportunities, create independent projects, shape story/role. Internal resources: advertise new teams, encourage rotations, run hackathons. Rotations: learn new language, explore different stack, sometimes permanently switch teams. Past 6 months: dozen+ engineers rotated between iOS mobile, core payment API, ML. Highlight roles for internal transfers - bootstrapping new team, complex technical problem. Direct longest-tenured engineers to projects where provide most help. Hackathons: don't need weeks of planning or new team. Recent hackathon: 80 participants across offices, shipped 7 projects to internal/external users (right-to-left language support, internal productivity tools). Ask for feedback and respond - requires scalable approach and careful listening. Employees recognize problems but don't always know how to translate to effective change. Three steps: identify problem, design way to collect structured feedback, address feedback/deliver results. Developer Experience survey example: engineers described dev environment as slow/inefficient. Formed team of experienced engineers focused on internal developer experience. Intuition/expertise not enough to identify most impactful projects. Launched survey: hours lost due to dev process problems, 1-2 things to make more productive, what's harder than it should be. Results: most common request (by factor of 2!) was faster/more reliable edit-sync-test loop. Team tackled projects to improve speed/reliability of syncing/reloading/testing. Next round months later: satisfaction improved 50-80%. Created positive feedback loop, engineers felt heard. Now run Developer Experience surveys every quarter. Key principle: how you scale team has enormous impact on culture, productivity, employee engagement, business success. At quickly growing companies, conditions change rapidly - what works today may not hold tomorrow. Continue iterating, develop new practices as grow.

## Managing Your Time as a Middle Manager

- **Source:** The Heartbeat Newsletter (Canopy)
- **Author:** Claire Lew (Founder & CEO of Canopy)
- **URL:** https://newsletter.canopy.is/p/managing-your-time-as-a-middle-manager
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Middle management, time management, player-coach, leadership, prioritization, fluid focus, context switching, work-life balance, management challenges
- **Key Insight:** How to allocate time when caught in the middle between direct reports and supervisors - the "player-coach" tension. Core problem: Leaders feel squeezed at both ends, overwhelmed, never knowing if priority is right, depleted trying to keep up. The toothpaste tube analogy: squeezed from both ends, no one concerned middle won't fit. Player-coach tension: On one end, expected to map team goals, hold 1:1s (coach role). On other end, asked to deliver tactical work - writing code, designing feature, creating marketing campaign (player role). Not inherently bad - player work keeps you connected to passion, keeps skills sharp. But lived experience feels bad - overwhelmed, depleted. DO NOT: Chase balance or believe perfect distribution exists. Balance is illusion. No magical formula. What's "best" depends on context - what's required of you, team, organization in that moment. DO: Figure out what's most high-leverage for your specific context. Ask: What's most urgent? What is team success most contingent on? What's most critical to team/organization at this moment? Might discover need to step back and nurture team, or double down on personal deliverables first. Examine which role (player or coach) would truly be high leverage. DO: Choose only 1 focus at a time, for specific period of time. Not two, just one. Decide what role you'll concentrate energy on, and for what period. Called "Fluid Focus." Example: Focus on coach role to help team navigate reorg - set aside 1 month. Intentionally place IC engineering work in back seat for that month. Accept trade - acknowledge won't get much (if any) progress on coding during that month. That's okay. Player role is something you'll come back to. To perform exceptionally well in one role rather than subpar in both, must pick one role to focus on at a time. Can switch focus later (Fluid Focus). However, none of this works if don't communicate it. DO NOT: Assume can put head down and just get job done. May seem great idea to focus purely on coach role for 1 month. But if team thinks receiving your code was top priority, they'll be confused why you haven't shipped it. If supervisor had deadline for code in mind, they'll believe you dropped the ball. DO: Communicate exactly the role you're prioritizing and why - with both team and supervisor. While may seem obvious to you, no one will know unless you tell them. Detail: (1) Role you're prioritizing (player or coach), (2) Period of time you'll be prioritizing that role, (3) Why you're prioritizing this role. Example to team: "For next 3 weeks, shifting priorities to focus on creation of new marketing campaign. As result, we'll pause our 1:1 meetings and team check-ins. May feel like I'm more absent than usual, but merely short phase to serve company's overall goals. Company's growth targets require I knock this out now, need focus deep work time. You can expect me to come out of this phase in 3 weeks, pick back up our 1:1 meetings again." Example to supervisors: "For next 3 weeks, thinking it makes sense to shift priorities to focus on completing creation of new marketing campaign - that way can hit deadline you intended for Q2 growth goals. Are you okay with me prioritizing this? If so, some managerial updates I usually send will be on pause for those 3 weeks, but happy to resume after phase completed. How does that sound?" For communication to supervisors in particular, actively asking for input on prioritization - ensures aligned with expectations, not superseding what supervisor believes most critical. DO NOT: Underestimate cost of context switching. Little wonder we're so tired as leaders. Context-switching consumes energy. Studies found 40% of productivity lost when context-switching. Accept that switching of context itself is work. Build in margin for that energy expenditure. Perhaps place 1 week buffer between modes as "catch up" time, where don't have specific focus on player or coach role. Gives time to evaluate which role might be best to focus on in next phase. Or maybe carve out break and take time off. DO NOT: Stay in 1 lane for too long... because you like it. Be wary of personal preferences for allocating time as leader. We all have bias to mode that's more "fun." For some, that's relishing being coach - helping team solve problems, coaching careers. For others, most comfortable jamming in deep work of player role. What we personally like is not always what situation requires. Must be truthful with ourselves to not conflate the two. The 4 Steps of Fluid Focus: (1) Stop chasing "balance." Commit to making trade. (2) Choose 1 role to focus on (player or coach) and period of time. (3) Communicate this choice to team and supervisor. (4) Readjust and reassess as needed. Inconvenient truth: Choice isn't obvious. Excruciatingly, almost impossibly hard to decide on just one role. Part of you wishes could "cheat" and do both roles at once. But remind yourself of toothpaste tube: Reason so exhausted and displeased is because squeezing yourself from both sides. Trying to do too many things at once. Embrace trade-off. Relish freedom to be fluid in focus. Side effects: Cognitive load of doing two roles at once slowly relieved. Find depth in work, not just surface area covered. Actual output of work more satisfactory. Reference to Andy Grove's "High Output Management": "My day always ends when I'm tired and ready to go home, not when I'm done. I'm never done." Managers have endless task list - leads to multi-tasking path. Worst part is feeling: mediocre at everything, great at nothing. Power of mono-tasking: choosing just one thing to do, and doing it well.

- **Key Insight:** Proposed Internet standard (not yet official IETF) that helps organizations describe vulnerability disclosure practices and preferences. Problem: Organizations get hacked because no obvious way for security researchers to report vulnerabilities or data leaks. Idea: Place file called security.txt in predictable place (example.com/security.txt or example.com/.well-known/security.txt). Contents vary but typically include: links to vulnerability disclosure policies, contact email address, links to bug bounty programs, public encryption keys, links thanking researchers, links to IT security job openings. Examples: USAA includes bug bounty program links, email, encryption key, disclosure policy, researcher thank you page. HCA Healthcare: contact email, responsible disclosure policies link, security job openings link. Why it matters: Makes easier to respond to active security threats. Real-world example: Major clothing retailer had VPN credentials stolen, no security.txt file, security@ email blocked, message to CIO - no way to know if read. Alex Holden (Hold Security): Malicious hackers often struggle getting attention of proper people in organizations they hacked. "In cases of ransom, bad guys try to contact company with demands. You have no idea how often their messages get caught in filters, get deleted, blocked or ignored." Many organizations unofficially use security@[companydomain] but not standardized or well-publicized, can be blocked. Adoption: Not yet official IETF standard, but 8% of Fortune 100 adopted (Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, HCA Healthcare, Kroger, Procter & Gamble, USAA, Walmart). Major downside: Setting up security.txt invites high volume of spam. Self-appointed penetration testers run automated vulnerability discovery tools, submit reports hoping for consulting engagement or bug bounty fee. Hacker News threads discuss being flooded with low-quality vulnerability scan reports, difficult to spot reports worth pursuing. Edwin "EdOverflow" Foudil (co-author of proposed standard) acknowledges: "Organizations that implement this are going to get flooded. One reason bug bounty programs succeed is they are basically glorified spam filter. But regardless of approach, going to get inundated with crappy, sub-par reports." Often from individuals who scanned entire Internet for one or two vulnerabilities, contacted all vulnerable organizations at once semi-automated. Managing noise: Many nuisance reports can be ignored or grouped by creating filters looking for keywords commonly found in automated vulnerability scans. Success stories: Tremendous feedback from universities that implemented security.txt. "Incredible success with universities, which tend to have lots of older, legacy systems. In that context, seen ton of valuable reports." Origin: Came about after chatting with people at DEFCON (annual security conference in Las Vegas) struggling to report security issues to vendors. Foudil not trying to make money off it. Main reason not promoting heavily: not yet official standard. Key takeaways: (1) Standardized way for organizations to publish vulnerability disclosure practices/contact info, (2) Solves real problem - lack of clear, predictable way for researchers to report vulnerabilities, (3) Trade-offs - easier for legitimate researchers but generates high volume of low-quality reports, (4) Spam can be managed with email filters/keyword filtering, (5) Particularly valuable for organizations with legacy systems (universities), (6) Not yet official but adopted by major Fortune 100 companies, suggesting practical value before formal IETF approval.

## SOC2: The Screenshots Will Continue Until Security Improves

- **Source:** Fly.io Blog
- **Author:** Thomas Ptacek (@tqbf)
- **URL:** https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** SOC2, compliance, security audit, DRL, Type I, Type II, SSO, access control, vulnerability management, security policies, operational security, security certification
- **Key Insight:** Practical guide to SOC2 compliance from someone who project-managed Fly.io's SOC2 certification. Bottom line for customers: SOC2 is weak positive indicator of security maturity, similar ballpark to penetration test report (but less than multiple pentests). Key distinctions: (1) SOC2 is accounting-style audit confirming on-paper claims about security processes, not like adversarial security audits/penetration tests. (2) About security of company (can customer support pop shell on prod?), not products (can attacker pop shell with SQL injection?). (3) Guts are giant spreadsheet questionnaire (DRL) and battery of screenshots as evidence. (4) DRL is high-level/abstract, product of accounting standards like COSO framework, understands "git" and "MFA" but nothing lower-level. (5) Two types: Type I (point-in-time snapshot), Type II (confirms consistent adherence over months). Can't flunk Type I but Type II more annoying - can't travel back in time to close gaps. What SOC2 assures that pentests don't: consistent access policies, everyone has 2FA, capability to fire alerts on weird logs, severed employees reliably have access terminated, company not run by 4 raccoons in trenchcoat (or policy written accepting risk). For customers: Intensely technical/high-risk engineering? Look for pentest. Huge number of employees? Get SOC2. What's SOC2: Best-known infosec certification, only one routinely demanded by customers. Structure: AICPA "Trust Services Criteria" and COSO framework. Categories: security (mandatory, only one matters for most), availability, transaction integrity, confidentiality, privacy. DRL = Document Request List - giant spreadsheet auditor customizes to your company after scoping call. Can't reason back to first principles - just take their word for it. When to SOC2: Wait as long as you can. Important distinction: "Getting SOC2-certified" ≠ "doing engineering work to get SOC2-certified". Do engineering now, as early as possible - work scales with team size. Audit itself doesn't matter except to answer customer request "can I have your SOC2 report?" Do it when more economical to get certification than hand-hold prospects through security process. Why customers ask: It's viral like GPL. DRL suggests policy to "collect SOC2 reports from all vendors". Customers ask because they're SOC2 and AICPA wants them to force you to join coven. Don't have to do it - can speak confidently about security practice or pay audit firm to make problem go away. Makes little sense to get certified before customers demand it. Can make purchase order contingent on Type I in next year. What SOC2 made Fly.io do: (1) Single Sign-On - every CSO says SSO was first 3 things. Obvious why: single place to control credentials (phishing-proof MFA), access to apps, offboarding. Moved everything to Google SSO. Inside network: certificate-based SSH access control (Teleport). To reach Teleport need VPN, to get VPN need Google SSO. Teleport authenticated separately via Github SSO. Two auth sources of truth for SSH. Teleport killer feature: transcript-level audit logs for every SSH session, can watch other team sessions, go back in time. "SSO tax" - pain to pay for SAAS accounts supporting SAML/OIDC. Early days can skip for non-sensitive vendors, but mostly just pay. (2) Protected Branches - surprisingly important to auditors. Concern: developer might "go rogue" and install malware. Easy to enable in Github but also need documented approval process ensuring changes reviewed. Fly.io wasn't doing this - have teams-of-one components. Solution: Post-facto reviews. Regular reviews on large components, smaller projects/urgent fixes can merge unreviewed (by authorized subset), Github bot flags PRs, weekly meeting to review. (3) Centralized Logging - big chunk of DRL about monitoring. Auditors nudge toward centralizing (but you want this anyway - every logging system is one to document/screenshot/write policy about). Fly.io got off easy - logging is platform feature, large ElasticSearch/VictoriaMetrics clusters, single query away from any event. SOC2 forced picking ticketing system (had avoided for years). Alerts to Slack/PagerDuty, documented ticketing processes. HelpScout surprise: got lots of SOC2 mileage - support/security@ mails go there, good system of record for events SOC2 cares about (internal/external security reports). (4) CloudTrail - barely use AWS but audit firms added AWS-specific line-items. Better at indexing/alerting CloudTrail now, not very useful to their security practice. (5) Infrastructure-as-Code - auditors know Terraform/CloudFormation, want you using it. Job is documenting how your deployment system is similar to Terraform. Host inventory annoyance: trivial for AWS (API/CLI), Fly.io runs own hardware, systems of record are idiosyncratic, ended up taking screenshots of SQL queries. (6) MDM/Endpoint Management - surprise: endpoint security has fallen out of fashion in 2022. Didn't have to document endpoint strategy. Can cross off checklist. (7) Boring Company Stuff - (a) Formal org chart posted where employees can find it. Annoying but whatever. (b) Evidence of annual performance reviews. Fly.io doesn't do annual (continuous feedback, 1-on-1 culture). AICPA can't assure terminated employee if no annual reviews. So now have pro-forma annual reviews. Need to carefully explain to team so don't think stack ranking. (c) Background checks - performative/intrusive, occasionally illegal (European employees), horror stories about flagging for missing transcripts. Only issue had to seriously back-and-forth with auditors. Held line on refusing, got out of it by finding what another company did, stealing process, telling auditors "do what you did for them". (8) Policies - going to write bunch. Most companies phone it in, Google template, adopt first result. Fly.io wrote their own. Simplified by Ryan McGeehan's "Starting Up Security" site (free). Information Security Policy based on Ryan's, all their own words (quotes grugq). Writing policies inspired by Ryan liberates you to write clearly, no "whereas" or "designee". Wrote: Information Security Policy (everyone signs), Data Classification Policy (what can go in Slack/Email vs talk to management), Document Retention policy (from lawyers), Change Management, Risk Assessment (says will build spreadsheet explaining zombie apocalypse handling), Vulnerability Management (roughly explains nmap), Access Request (which Slack channel), Vendor Management (propagates SOC2 virus to vendors), Incident Response (cribbed from Ryan), Business Continuity (Jerome in charge if Kurt arrested for robbing bank), employee handbook. Slab verification feature: highest ROI feature - click button, adds green banner saying "verified" for next several months. Several DRL items about recertifying policies annually - this gave screenshots needed. What Fly.io didn't let SOC2 make them do: (1) Install endpoint software, (2) Run vulnerability scanner (automated nmap for compliance), (3) Collect SOC2 reports from all vendors (will do soon-ish), (4) Clear Prototype Injection alerts from Dependabot for Javascript projects, (5) Install agent software on servers (terrified of agents), (6) Run antivirus on servers (explained why doesn't make sense - documented deployment/CI/CD), (7) Run any other security product (IDS, WAF, SEM, DAST, ASM, XDR, CASB, anything with "mesh"). The Audit Itself: People joke about screenshots - they're not joking. Whole SOC2 audit is essentially series of screenshots. Jarring if you've had security audits by consulting firms (technical experts jump into codebase, try to find flaws). Nothing like that in SOC2 - it's actual audit. DRL line items ask for evidence supporting claims (e.g. "production repos on Github have protected branches"). Evidence almost always screenshots of management interface with feature enabled. Divided evidence collection into series of calls over week, each ~20 minutes, mostly sharing screen saying "that checkbox over there, screenshot that". Prepared for tricky calls, but was chill process. Most important thing: Keep goals modest. Claims you make in Type I bind on Type II; claims you don't make in Type I won't. One Type I goal should be helping future self clear Type II. About report quality: Concerned quality would matter to customers. Got good auditors, wasn't paint-by-numbers. But talking to security people at other companies, takeaway: having SOC2 report is what matters, not what it says. The five Type I reports trick: Peer at highly clueful security-sensitive firm described vendor giving them five consecutive Type I reports. Can skip all real work! (Spent weeks convincing CEO not to do this.) What SOC2 misses: Fly.io does lots of security work SOC2 doesn't care about - misses most of their security model. Build in memory-safe languages, minimize trust between components, simple access control models, get code pentested. SOC2 doesn't communicate this - and that's fine. Can write own security report explaining what they do. For all cynicism, SOC2 dragged them into process improvements they're glad to have. Helped to have clueful auditors, clear eye about what trying to accomplish. Expected "entire new cloud provider" to be complicated case but went smoothly. If easy for them, probably easier for you. Just don't do it until you have to.

## Good Engineering Strategy Is Boring

- **Source:** Irrational Exuberance (lethain.com)
- **Author:** Will Larson (Author of "An Elegant Puzzle," "Staff Engineer," "The Engineering Executive's Primer," and "Crafting Engineering Strategy")
- **URL:** https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering strategy, engineering vision, design documents, RFCs, tech specs, bottoms-up organizational learning, strategy synthesis, tradeoffs, decision-making
- **Key Insight:** Practical, bottoms-up approach to writing engineering strategy and vision. Core insight: Good engineering strategy is boring, and it's easier to write an effective strategy than a bad one. The process: (1) Write five design documents describing decisions and tradeoffs in specific projects. Design docs have what bad strategies lack - detailed specifics grounded in reality. It's easy for two engineers to interpret abstract strategy differently, but harder to stay misaligned when implementing specific solution. When to write design docs: projects used by numerous future projects, projects meaningfully impacting users, work taking more than month of engineering time. Best practices: Start from problem (clearer problem = more obvious solutions), keep template simple (minimal templates, select useful sections, exhaustive details only for riskiest), gather and review together/write alone (collect input widely but one author writes clearer document than group edits), prefer good over perfect (better to get good document in front of others than delay). To improve: reread designs after implementation, study where implementation deviated from plan. (2) Synthesize five design docs into strategy - read all five together, look for controversial decisions that came up in multiple designs, particularly those hard to agree on. Example: debating whether Redis appropriate as durable storage or only cache - write down recent decisions and rationale as strategy. Good strategies guide tradeoffs and explain rationale. Bad strategies state policy without explanation, decoupling from context. Strategy definition = "diagnosis" and "guiding policies" (deferring "coherent action" to design documents). Best practices: Start where you are (dive in, waiting for missing information doesn't work, whatever you write will need to change), write specifics (write until you generalize then stop, specific statements create alignment, generic create illusion), be opinionated (provide clarity on decision making), show your work (explain rationale so others can modify/extend as context shifts). Some best strategies feel too obvious to write - "When should we write design documents?", "Which databases for which use cases?", "Which services page during off-hours" are all worth writing. (3) Extrapolate five strategies into vision - as collect more strategies, becomes challenging to reason about how strategies interact. Take five recent strategies, extrapolate how tradeoffs will play out over next 2-3 years. Edit through contradictions, weave threads together = engineering vision. Gives "robust belief in the future" (Tanya Reilly) making it easier to understand how existing strategies relate, simplifies writing new strategies. Best practices: Write 2-3 years out (companies/tech change quickly, too far is fraught, too short doesn't work), ground in business and users (tight connection keeps vision aligned with leadership values, bad visions treat technical sophistication as self-justifying), be optimistic not audacious (ambitious but possible, best possible version of possible, write what could accomplish if projects finished on time, don't write infinite resources version), stay concrete and specific (more useful as more specific, generic easy to agree with but don't help reconcile conflicts), keep 1-2 pages long (most people don't read long documents, compact with links to extra context). Managing expectations: Response to vision usually muted - core audience is folks writing strategies (small cohort), great vision is so obvious it bores more than excites. Don't measure by initial excitement. Measure by reading design document from two years ago vs last week - if marked improvement, vision is good. When and why: Strategies are tools of proactive alignment, empower teams to move quickly with confidence, allow everyone to make quick confident decisions (would otherwise cost week of discussion). Write strategy when you've rehashed same discussion 3-4 times. Write vision when future's too hazy to identify investments worth making. If neither sound familiar, move on to other work. The prework: If can't resist urge to include brilliant ideas, write all best ideas into giant document, delete it, never mention again. Clears head for work ahead - process should be grounded in what you've actually done, not what you wish you'd done. Key principle: Durably useful engineering strategy and vision are output of iterative, bottoms-up organizational learning. All learning contributes to strategy and vision, but contribution doesn't have to be abstract. Even if not directly responsible, can take practical steps to advance organization's strategy and vision starting right now.

## Is Engineering Strategy Useful?

- **Source:** Irrational Exuberance (lethain.com)
- **Author:** Will Larson (Author of "An Elegant Puzzle," "Staff Engineer," "The Engineering Executive's Primer," and "Crafting Engineering Strategy")
- **URL:** https://lethain.com/is-engineering-strategy-useful/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Original Source:** This is a chapter from "Crafting Engineering Strategy"
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering strategy, written strategy, implicit strategy, organizational learning, strategy impact, strategy costs, personal development, strategy value
- **Key Insight:** Why engineering strategy matters and why written strategy is valuable. Core insight: There's always an engineering strategy, even if nothing written down. Strategy embedded into organization's decisions, although in many organizations only visible to small group and may be quickly forgotten. If thinking strategy doesn't exist, ask where strategy lives if can't find it. May find it ineffective, but never found that it doesn't exist. Strategy is impactful: Creating alignment (example: Calm's engineering strategy reduced friction by eliminating cause of ongoing debate, reset team focus, caused some engineers to leave because incompatible with priorities - not downside, clear documented strategy let everyone accurately decide if wanted to be part of game). Ways strategies support organizations: (1) Concentrating company investment into smaller space (e.g., deciding not to decompose monolith allows investing majority of tooling on one language, one test suite, one deployment mechanism), (2) Many interesting properties only available through universal adoption (e.g., "N-1 policy" on backfilled roles significant opportunity for managing costs but only works if consistently adopted, disaster recovery/multi-region strategies only viable if all infrastructure has common configuration mechanism), (3) Focus execution on what truly matters (e.g., Stripe's Sorbet strategy allowed team of ten engineers to incrementally move Ruby monolith towards static typing without distracting larger organization, could have consumed entire organization for many months but focus allowed small team accomplish majority of early work), (4) Creating knowledge repository of how organization thinks (onboarding new hires, particularly senior, much more effective with documented strategy, e.g., strategy for accessing user data requires clear user-understandable rationale for access - obvious to new hires from larger companies but folks with only small company experience likely completely unaware necessary, if not documented compliance quickly declines). However developing strategy creates progress even if progress is understanding inherent disagreement. Inappropriate strategy especially impactful: While good strategy accomplishes many things, inappropriate strategy feels far more impactful (in wrong ways). Example: Digg V4 - complete rewrite from PHP monolith to PHP frontend and backend of dozen Python services, moved database from sharded MySQL to early version of Cassandra, replaced nuanced algorithms developed over decade with hack implemented few days before launch. Although Digg likely would have struggled to become profitable due to reliance on SEO for traffic and Google's frequently changing search algorithm, engineering strategy ensured died fast rather than having opportunity to dig way out. Not just Digg - almost every engineering organization has unused platform projects that captured decades of engineering years to detriment of important opportunity. Shocking number of senior leaders join new companies and initiate grand migration attempting to entirely rewrite architecture, switch programming languages, or shift organization to resemble prior organization where understood things better. Term "inappropriate" rather than "bad" - same strategy might be very effective in different circumstances (e.g., if Digg had been three person company with no revenue, rewriting from scratch could have been right decision). Every approach undoubtedly works in some organization. Written strategy drives organizational learning: Example Carta - inconsistent approach to important problems, teams had distinct standard kits, adoption of existing internal platforms inconsistent, decision making around funding new internal platforms inconsistent, widespread agreement decomposing monolith but no agreement on how. Coming into permissive strategy environment with strong differing perspectives, wrote explicit engineering strategy with Navigators team (explicitly named technical leaders representing key parts of engineering organization - representative leadership group made possible to iterate on strategy with small team of about ten engineers representing entire organization rather than negotiate with 400 engineers directly). Written strategy made possible to explicitly describe problems seen and how wanted to navigate them, artifact able to iterate on in small group then share widely for feedback, could revise and update over time (e.g., extending to mention AI/LLMs, then revising again as dive into agentic workflows). Disagreement is feature - lot of people disagreed with parts, great benefit of written strategy is possible to precisely disagree, from disagreement able to evolve strategy (sometimes new information, other times initial approach could be improved). New hires able to disagree from informed place rather than coming across attached to prior company's practices, able to understand historical thinking motivating decisions even when context no longer obvious. With oral history, what you believe highly dependent on who you talk with, shapes view of history and present. With written history, far more possible to agree at scale, prerequisite to growing at scale rather than isolating growth to small pockets of senior leadership. Cost of implicit strategy: Vulnerable to misinterpretation - information flow in verbal organizations depends on individual being in room for decision then accurately repeating to others who need it, common to see fail to repeat elsewhere or interpretation faulty, both create significant problems. "Two-headed organizations" solution - two leaders (manager and senior engineer) to reduce communication errors, errors in point-to-point communication so prevalent one-to-one that only solution for non-reading-oriented communicators was ensuring communicated strategy to at least two people. Inconsistency across teams - example: promotions to Staff-plus role happened at much higher rate in infrastructure engineering than product engineering, created constant drain out of product engineering to work on infrastructure-shaped problems even if not valuable to business, new leaders had no idea informal policy existed, routinely ran into trouble in calibration discussions, also weren't aware needed to argue for better policy, worse no one sure if real policy or not so ultimately random whether perspective represented for any promotion (sometimes good promotions blocked, sometimes borderline cases approved). Inconsistency over time - implementing new policy mix of persistent and one-time actions, e.g., standardize all HTTP operations to use same library across codebase (add linter check, one-time pass), but two years later another three random HTTP libraries in codebase creeping into cracks. If policy written down and few people read it, number of ways could be prevented. If not written down, much less likely someone remembers, much less likely remember rationale well enough to argue about it. Hazard to new leadership - when new Staff-plus engineer or executive joins, common to blame them for failing to understand existing context behind decisions (fair: big part of senior leadership uncovering and understanding context, unfair: explicit documentation would have made much easier). Every particularly bad new-leader onboarding involved new leader coming into unfilled role that manager didn't know how to do, success entirely dependent on new leader's ability and interest in learning. Practice of documenting strategy has lot in common with succession planning - full benefits accrue to organization rather than individual doing it, possible to maintain when original authors present, appreciating value requires stepping outside yourself to value things that matter most to organization when you're no longer member. Information herd immunity - frequent objection "no one reads anything", some truth but extremely hard to get everyone to know something, never found that goal particularly important. View of information dispersal same as herd immunity: don't need everyone to know something, just enough people who know something that confusion doesn't propagate too far. Impossible for all engineers to know strategy details, but can have every Staff-plus engineer and engineering manager know those details. Strategy supports personal learning: While largest benefits accrue to organization, strategy is underrated avenue for self-development. (1) Creating strategy builds self-awareness - example: engineers viewing themselves extremely senior but frequently demanded projects implemented using new programming languages/technologies because personally wanted to learn (internal strategy clear - wanted to work on something fun), but following steps to build engineering strategy would have created strategy even they agreed didn't make sense. (2) Strategy supports situational awareness in new environments - Wardley mapping talks about situational awareness as prerequisite to good strategy (ensuring understand realities of circumstances, most destructive failure of new senior engineering leaders), by explicitly stating diagnosis where strategy applied makes easier to debug why reusing prior strategy in new team/company might not work. (3) Strategy as personal archive - documented strategy is institutional memory and personal memory to understand impact of prior approaches, each of us archivist of prior work pulling out valuable pieces to address problem at hand, over long career memory fades and motivated reasoning creeps in but explicit documentation doesn't. Part of reason started working on book now rather than later - realized starting to forget details of strategy work did earlier in career, if wanted to preserve wisdom of that era and ensure didn't have to relearn same lessons, had to write now. Summary: Two key themes most frequently ignored - (1) There's always a strategy even if isn't written down, (2) Single biggest act to further strategy in organization is write down strategy so can be debated, agreed upon, and explicitly evolved. Discussions around strategy often get caught up in high prestige activities like making controversial decisions, but most effective strategists make more progress by performing basics: writing things down, exploring widely to see how other companies solve same problem, accepting feedback into draft from folks who disagree. Strategy is useful, and doing strategy can be simple too.

## Follow Culture First, Don't Start by Changing It

- **Source:** Engineering Strategy (learnings.aleixmorgadas.dev)
- **Author:** Aleix Morgadas
- **URL:** https://learnings.aleixmorgadas.dev/p/do-not-start-by-changing-the-culture
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Organizational culture, cultural change, middle management, engineering leadership, culture dimensions, organizational behavior, change management
- **Key Insight:** Start with small processes that eventually lead to cultural change, rather than trying to change culture directly. For middle management, following the culture is the path of least resistance to achieve goals. Core insight: Aiming to drive company cultural change as middle management is recipe for burnout. Instead, follow the culture - it is path for less resistance to achieve what you aim to achieve. Understanding culture: Culture refers to shared values, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and practices that define how business operates and how employees interact. Long story short: how decisions are made. Based on Tanya Reilly's "The Staff Engineer's Path," when people ask about culture they refer to: How much autonomy will I have? Will I feel included? Will it be safe to make mistakes? Will I be part of decisions that affect me? How difficult will it be to make progress on projects? Are people nice? Culture is how we behave in day to day, how we make decisions, and based on which values. Seven dimensions to describe culture (from Tanya Reilly's book): (1) Secret vs. Open - How much does everyone know? Information is currency? Calendars private? Slack channels invitation only? Everyone has access to everything? Even messy first drafts? (2) Oral vs. Written - What gets shared by word of mouth vs written down? How much writing and review involved in decisions? Features come with formal specifications or need to go to person who made feature? (3) Top-down vs. Bottom-up - Where do initiatives come from? Bottom-up culture where employees/teams empowered to make own decisions and champion initiatives they think important, but when need support they slow down. (4) Fast vs. Deliberate - Rapid decisions and pivot abruptly to try new opportunity, or need to show thought through whole plan before executing? (5) Back channels vs. Front doors - How do people in different groups talk? Formal path via teams' managers, or people can send friendly DMs cross teams? (6) Allocated vs. Available - How much time does everyone have? Teams understaffed or overworked? Able to absorb new work as appears, or ends in backlog needs prioritized in next cycle? (7) Liquid vs. Crystallized - Where do power, status, reputation come from? How gain trust? Clear hierarchy? In specific point in hierarchy, as others move up you also move? Or more Liquid, offers room for change, need to move yourself to be promoted. Understanding your culture first: Two common responses when asking leaders about culture: (1) "That's not the type of company I want to be part of," (2) "That's why we're not able to drive necessary change, culture isn't helping us, need to change it first so can do necessary changes later." Culture never black or white, grey scale in multiple levels. Describe differently for overall company culture vs tribe's vs team's. Two scenarios for improving culture: C-level (CTO/CIO) vs Middle management (VPs, Heads of Engineering, Engineering Managers, Staff/Principal Engineers). Focus on middle management where driving cultural change more challenging. The middle management challenge: When talking to middle managers and Principal Engineers, challenges often not about culture as goal to accomplish but as blocker to achieve desired outcome. Typical: "I want to drive initiative to accomplish A, but would be easier if had more Y culture. How can I influence leadership to change culture?" Answer: Don't aim to change culture. Cultural change takes time, requires constant leadership support, lot of patience. By time achieved that, challenge now will no longer matter. Instead, follow culture - path for less resistance. If approach/plan/strategy isn't possible due to cultural restrictions, problem is your approach not possible in that context. Need to find another way that fits company's culture way of working. Can mean: need to play company's rules like being in right meetings with right people, or even need to move into management career to influence decisions where it happens. Focus on achieving goals and overcoming challenges within scope of action first. Once in middle of progress, aim to influence culture as part of journey. Cultural change is part of process: Best way to influence company culture is part of succeeding in high stake business challenges. Shouldn't aim for highly disruptive new way of working, but "the adjacent possible." Example: If part of organization with top-down approach, secretive, oral-based communication, can start influencing by driving initiative making information available and written, but keeping approach top-down. Don't want to change too many ways of doing stuff at same time. When you succeed: (1) Achieve business objectives first, delivering company and customer value, (2) Create trust between all parties (high level leadership and teams), (3) Show that by doing X, Y, Z achieved objectives. Company's love success, we all try to repeat success. Next time face similar challenge, default approach will be new ways of working. When you fail: (1) Learn why failed - don't blame culture, understand why approach didn't succeed, then adapt methods and try new approaches, (2) Don't create high resistance to change due to disruptive new ways of working - can prevent any new improvement initiatives in future. Worst: people stop believing in change. Make it iterative: Don't try to change everything at once. Make small, incremental changes that fit within existing culture. As succeed with these changes, they become new default, gradually shifting culture. Aim for "adjacent possible" - changes one step away from where are, not massive disruptions. Reduces resistance, increases chances of success. Iterative approach: (1) Understand culture using 7 dimensions, (2) Identify smallest change moving toward goal, (3) Make that change within existing cultural constraints, (4) Succeed or learn from failure, (5) Repeat with next adjacent change. Key takeaways: Culture is how decisions made - understand first before trying to change. Use 7 dimensions to map organization culture. For middle management, follow culture first - aiming to drive cultural change directly is recipe for burnout. If approach doesn't fit, problem is your approach - find another way that fits. Cultural change happens through success - influence by succeeding in high-stake business challenges using new ways of working. Aim for adjacent possible - small incremental changes rather than disruptive transformations. Make it iterative - one step at a time, building on each success. Success creates trust and new defaults - when companies see success with new approaches, become default for future challenges. Failure is learning not blame - understand why approaches fail and adapt, don't blame culture. Avoid creating resistance - disruptive changes can prevent future improvement initiatives.

## Using Cultural Survey Data

- **Original Source:** This is an unedited chapter from O'Reilly's "The Engineering Executive's Primer"
- **Key Concepts:** Cultural surveys, employee feedback, survey analysis, data literacy, executive accountability, organizational culture, team trust, survey action planning, survey frequency
- **Key Insight:** How to effectively read, analyze, and take action on cultural survey results to build trust and address team concerns. Context: Almost every scaled company runs cultural surveys (vendors like CultureAmp or Lattice, or in-house tools). Surveys ask about experience working in company, cross-team collaboration, compensation, etc. Results tallied, reports generated for each manager about their team, executive team gets company-wide report. Senior leaders usually don't spend much time on survey results, but they're great lens into data literacy and how leaders prioritize limited resources to address broad problem space. Valuable mechanism for earning credibility by following through to address concerns. Reading results: Quick advice - spend couple hours digesting results, focus more on absolute scores than relative (high score still high even if relatively down), identify all issues not just first couple noticed. Formalized 10-step approach: (1) Check access - ensure whole company access not just engineering report, executive team should see full results (transparency helps gel executive team, see cross-functional patterns like Engineering and Product both frustrated, identify areas other functions frustrated with Engineering). (2) Create private document for notes - screen capture data raising issues, add commentary, staging ground not final product. (3) Understand population sizes - build intuition for statistical significance (changes significant in org of 2,000 but technical program manager team of 7, extreme change probably not significant). Be skeptical of narratives - survey tools incentivized to produce narratives even if weak, cautiously skeptical of analysis lacking statistical significance, use comments/follow-ups rather than raw numbers for non-significant findings. (4) Skim and categorize - group into three categories: things to celebrate, things to proactively address, things to acknowledge. Capture highlights in addition to concerns (never want purely negative update). (5) Check previous investments - how did you perform on areas identified after last survey? Highlight success, form hypothesis if didn't have impact. (6) Focus on extremes - highest and lowest absolute ratings, have they changed, did you expect them to change? (7) Focus on rapid changes - ratings changing fastest, what's driving rapid shift? (8) Compare across cohorts - different managers, tenure, gender, location. (9) Read every comment - copy most relevant to notes, what subjective feedback changes interpretation, what comments to quote when sharing summary. (10) Discuss with peer - spend hour with peer (e.g., head of product) after they've reviewed their report. Identify connected themes across orgs, find gaps in analysis. Don't do with direct report (messy discussing peers, avoid thorniest issues). Taking action: Problem - teams spend time running/analyzing but never use analysis for anything (frustrates team, trains them to ignore future surveys). Other extreme - earnest leaders commit to fixing everything (team loves initially, but six months later little progress). Middle path - identify few important areas where can make real progress, actually do work. Standard pattern: (1) Address acute issues immediately - manager whose team in open revolt, ethical issue raised. (2) Select 2-3 investment areas - use analysis notes, invest until next survey (e.g., increasing representation for Staff-plus engineers in key decision making forums, increasing sense of belonging for remote employees). (3) Create shareable document - edit notes and investment areas into document comfortable sharing, err on transparent but optimistic transparency (things relatively down often still absolutely high, recent trend down important but still significantly higher than historical averages). (4) Review with multiple stakeholders - direct reports (team meeting), People/HR partner, peers on executive team, 2-3 trusted individual contributors within Engineering (more sensitive to issues easier to miss as executive). (5) Incorporate feedback carefully - reviewers always find something important missed, listen carefully even if doesn't initially resonate. (6) Define explicit, verifiable actions - abstract commitments don't build trust, ambiguous whether followed through. (7) Share and discuss - share document with organization, schedule meeting to discuss findings and priorities with entire engineering organization (often repurpose Engineering Q&A sessions). (8) Follow up monthly - progress against action items (often include in weekly updates). (9) Mention improvements next survey - team takes survey more seriously if know you took action last time, helps score higher on questions about making improvements, new hires won't know if improvements made unless do this. Outcome: Straightforward process builds team trust and stronger culture. Executives rarely held accountable unless expose themselves to accountability. Valuable opportunity to hold yourself accountable to team. As hold yourself accountable, becomes easier to hold team accountable. Questions to ask: Executive teams debate adding questions every time survey about to run. While important to ensure good coverage, generally default questions good enough, not worthwhile to change. Two types of data: (1) Ratings on questions - valuable because can compare across cohorts, more useful seeing trends over time. Expensive to change - each change wipes out historical context, changes from default mean can't compare against industry benchmarks. Recommend against changing unless folks frequently confused (e.g., confusion between "the Management Team" vs "your manager" - executive team refers to itself as "Management Team" but wider company doesn't know, confusion invalidates results so change for clarity more valuable than preserving continuity). (2) Free-form responses - provide subjective context. Relatively cheap to change - no history to wipe out. However, if folks have something to say, they'll say it anywhere even if question somewhat unrelated. Adding more free-form questions doesn't change that, so as long as handful of open-ended questions, don't worry about adding more. Conclusion: Worth evaluating questions before first rollout, but repeated arguments about changing questions is executive bikeshedding. Starting and frequency: When to start - small organizations with genuine relationship with every team member won't get much from survey. As organization grows, become more useful. Dunbar's number (roughly 150) good point to ensure running surveys. Frequency - most run twice a year, reasonable amount. Principled way to determine: consider how much time willing to invest addressing issues raised. If struggling to address concerns from biannual surveys, doesn't make sense to run more frequently (annoy folks, complain about running another survey before addressing previously raised concerns). It can be uncomfortable: Sometimes embarrassed by scores. Called out for not paying attention to team's priorities. Tried to prioritize remote working experience, regressed rather than improved. Had below average scores and bad scores. Approach: Take moment, be uncomfortable with it. It means you care! Then lean into feedback, use to motivate addressing issues. Key takeaways: (1) Cultural surveys valuable lenses - reveal data literacy and how leaders prioritize limited resources. (2) Reading results requires structure - systematic approach: check access, create notes, understand population sizes, categorize, compare, read comments, discuss with peers. (3) Focus on absolute scores - high score still high even if relatively down. (4) Be skeptical of narratives - survey tools incentivized to produce narratives, cautiously skeptical especially of analysis lacking statistical significance. (5) Take action on 2-3 areas - don't commit to fixing everything but don't ignore results. (6) Be transparent and optimistic - share broadly but frame optimistically. (7) Define explicit, verifiable actions - abstract commitments don't build trust. (8) Follow up monthly - regular updates build trust. (9) Don't change questions unnecessarily - preserve historical context and industry benchmarking. (10) Start around 150 people (Dunbar's number). (11) Run twice a year typically - frequency should match capacity to address concerns. (12) Embrace discomfort - bad scores uncomfortable but means you care, use as motivation.

## Engineering a Culture of Psychological Safety

- **Source:** Intercom Blog
- **Author:** John Looney (Former Site Reliability Engineer at Google, part of Team Development group that contributed to Project Aristotle)
- **URL:** https://www.intercom.com/blog/psychological-safety/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Psychological safety, Project Aristotle, team culture, engineering management, team building, respect, innovation, failure, communication, trust
- **Key Insight:** The top indicator of a successful team isn't tenure, seniority or salary levels. It's psychological safety. Based on Project Aristotle findings from Google. Five warning signs of unsafe teams: (1) "If I take a chance, and screw up, it will be held against me" - mistakes held against people, never try to innovate again without explicit permission. (2) "Our team has a strong sense of culture, and it's hard for new people to join" - defending reputation more important than new hires, team/manager don't have your back. (3) "My team is slow to offer help to people who are struggling" - no formal training, no signals it's OK to learn, develop impostor syndrome. (4) "Using my unique skills and talents come second to the objectives of the team" - skills go unused, grow frustrated, drop proposals without discussion. (5) "It's uncomfortable to have open, honest conversations about our team's sensitive issues" - can't discuss root causes, look for new job. Unsafe teams can deliver short-term but eventually break or underperform drastically because people can't introduce change. How to build: (1) Balance culture with openness to change - respect culture but be open to changing it as needed (team working from home needs to change for interns, on-call culture may need professionalization). (2) Balance work people love with work company needs - great managers expand team remit to use engineers' skills rather than just moving poor fits. (3) Make respect part of culture - "the standard you walk past is the standard you accept" (David Morrison), challenge disrespect immediately, politely, in front of everyone. Examples: assumptions about technical ability (female PM with PhD), mocking previous positions, quiet engineers talked over. (4) Make space for people to take chances - innovation time/wiggle weeks (Intercom's 6-week sprints), but not only then, improve ideas rather than discounting them. (5) Make it obvious when team is doing well - celebrate visible success (Post-It goals), celebrate glorious failure (Google storage SRE example - learned more in 3 days than 3 months, toast what was learned). (6) Clear communication and explicit expectations - build systems (SLOs) rather than yelling, ask for specific commitments, make post-mortems learning opportunities not witch-hunts, set expectations upfront. Action steps: (1) Give team short survey, share results, (2) Discuss what "Safety" means, share when felt "unsafe", (3) Build culture of respect & clear communication starting with your actions. Treat psychological safety as key business metric (as important as revenue, cost of sales, uptime). The Karen story: Graduate makes optimization that causes outage, labeled "irresponsible", no one defends her, no training offered, skills go unused, can't discuss problems, leaves company with design that could have saved product. Key takeaways: (1) Psychological safety is #1 indicator of team success, (2) Unsafe teams break eventually, (3) Five warning signs, (4) Balance culture with openness to change, (5) Balance work people love with work company needs, (6) Make respect part of culture, (7) Make space for people to take chances, (8) Celebrate both success and glorious failure, (9) Clear communication and explicit expectations, (10) Treat as business metric.

## Culture Eats Strategy For Breakfast

- **URL:** https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/12/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Company culture, organizational culture, culture engineering, vision/mission/values, scaling startups, team unity, founder leadership, culture reinforcement, anti-fragility
- **Key Insight:** Personal journey from skeptic to believer about culture's importance. Core principle: "Culture eats strategy for breakfast, technology for lunch, and products for dinner, and soon thereafter everything else too." Culture is operationalizing of organization's values (Edgar Schein concept), guides employee decisions about technical business decisions and interactions, creates internal coherence. Culture can be engineered - happens whether you want it to or not, DNA of company created by founders through actions not words. Not having culture is a choice - decision to not create culture is choosing what culture will prevail (and not for better). Examples: (1) Cambridge Decision Dynamics failed - not because of technology/product/customers but because no meaningful purpose to create team unity to fight through tough times. (2) Eventbrite - consciously engineered culture, palpable energy/excitement, started with testing for humility in hiring ("no assholes" rule), evolved to "GSD" (Get Stuff Done) attitude, "you can't complain here - if you see something wrong, you must fix it" rule, anything can be changed/we own the culture, result: $2B in tickets sold, super-responsive support team. (3) IBM - three core values (respect for individual, superlative customer service, pursuit of excellence), reinforced through training (often two years), monthly communications, performance-appraisal system, role models, every decision, made company great in 1980s/early 1990s. Decline came from erosion of management commitment to values (cutting corners for short-term objectives), ambiguity about values contributed to fall, led to Lou Gerstner as CEO who said "I came to see in my time at IBM that culture isn't just one aspect of the game – it is the game. In the end an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value." (4) Kayak - unique culture from Paul English, culture of excellence/productivity from hiring through operations, three-person meeting maximum (no more wasting time), culture of action and accountability trading off consensus, reinforced daily through behavior/conference room size/incentive system, made no apologies for culture not working for everyone, result: $1.25M revenue per employee (double industry average), sold for $1.8B to Priceline. (5) Dyn - founders believed deeply in strong culture, environment exceptional at allowing honesty about mistakes, driving rectification, celebrating/immortalizing technical efforts, made visible through real estate/visitor handling/leadership actions/movie posters (example: customer broken workflow solution made it "even your parents can figure it out", poster signed by team permanently hung in headquarters), result: grew from 53 employees (2011) to 300 employees, success in unconventional location. Culture creates anti-fragility (Nassim Taleb concept) - positive culture takes inherently fragile human system and makes it anti-fragile (gets stronger with random events), strong product plan great but takes strong culture to handle adverse scenarios positively, unpredictable world of fast-growing startup with daily decisions makes venture stronger rather than weaker/confused. Key takeaways: (1) Culture matters more than strategy/technology/products, (2) Culture can be engineered, (3) Culture is operationalized values, (4) Not having culture is a choice, (5) Founders create culture through actions not words, (6) Culture must be reinforced consistently, (7) Culture creates anti-fragility, (8) Different cultures work for different companies, (9) Culture must be visible, (10) Start with hiring, (11) Culture enables scaling, (12) "Culture is the game" (Gerstner).

## Habits of High-Functioning Teams

- **Source:** deniseyu.io
- **Author:** Denise Yu (Engineer and sketchnoter)
- **URL:** https://deniseyu.io/2020/05/23/habits-of-high-performing-teams.html
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** High-performing teams, psychological safety, software development hygiene, team communication, experience distribution, code documentation, generous communication, team dynamics
- **Key Insight:** Documented characteristics and habits of highest-performing teams based on direct experience working with hundreds of developers. Four key habits: (1) High psychological safety - observable behaviors: regular retrospectives with real issues (not just sunshine/rainbows), explicit/implicit "struggle timebox" for asking help without judgment, individuals dissociate value from visible output ("Here's what we delivered" vs "Here's what I delivered"), people take more PTO/sick time (symptom of alignment/trust). Process experiments possible when high safety (example: Feedback Week - one-week process where everyone randomly assigned to collect feedback for another, created self-reinforcing positive feedback cycle). True psychological safety goes deeper than training - requires understanding invisible social structures, social privilege, how they affect participation, otherwise microaggressions/stereotype threat/survivorship bias manifest. (2) Good hygiene practices - Woods Theorem: "As complexity of system increases, accuracy of any single agent's model decreases rapidly." Can't have comprehensive mental model of large systems, rely on artifacts left by previous developers. Good hygiene = taking extra time to record present-day context: descriptive commit messages (at minimum verb, some teams require issue numbers), intention-revealing class/method names following conventions, unit tests with helpful descriptions/realistic variable names, keeping communication in tracking issues not Slack DMs. About empathy - for teammates (cleaner artifacts = less context-switching) and future self (3am pager pay-off). (3) Active redistribution of "experience points" - RPG analogy (Fire Emblem/Pokemon): level up characters evenly, don't let high-level characters hog experience from low/mid-level. In software: every new piece of work spreads domain context and confidence, don't constantly deploy only senior developers to tackle difficult stories, healthy teams engage in context redistribution so less experienced engineers gain valuable experience points. No central tactician role (managers/PMs don't count - not enough visibility/context, bad to centralize on one person). Raises productivity and morale if everyone feels somewhat equipped to tackle challenges, or knows can ask for help. (4) Communicating generously - Robustness principle (Nat Friedman): "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept." Principle of charity. Codebar mentor training: "Assume every student has limited information, but infinite intelligence." Assume peer is competent/intelligent/reasonable asking question because lacking context, has already attempted to procure on own. Frustrating to have context/experience "rounded down" constantly (gendered element). Examples: Lack of generosity - assume questioner doesn't know basics, provide articles on fundamentals, creates friction. Generosity - check assumptions first ("I'm guessing you're asking about... Stop me if wrong"), gets to solution faster, fewer words, no unnecessary friction, united in slaying uncertainty rather than jousting over knowledge levels. Key takeaways: (1) High psychological safety enables process experiments, (2) Goes deeper than training (social structures/privilege), (3) Observable behaviors (retros with real issues, struggle timebox, value separated from output, more PTO), (4) Good hygiene is empathy, (5) Hygiene practices (descriptive commits, intention-revealing names, helpful tests, context in issues), (6) Redistribute experience points, (7) No central tactician, (8) Communicate generously (assume competence), (9) Check assumptions first, (10) Generosity creates positive cycles.

## Don't Pave the Path Used by the Unhappy Cows

- **Author:** Kellan (Previously SVP at Blink Health, CTO at Etsy, Flickr Architect)
- **URL:** https://medium.com/@kellan/dont-pave-the-path-used-by-the-unhappy-cows-fef7a78777f8
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Culture and technology, tool building culture, microservices, cultural problems, supporting culture, positive feedback loops, automation and culture
- **Key Insight:** The nuance between "don't solve cultural problems with technology" and "be a tool building culture." You can't solve your cultural problems with technology, but you can support your culture with technology. Core insight: "Pave the cow paths, just don't pave the paths used by the unhappy cows." If teams don't respect each other and can't communicate, microservices architecture that decouples deploys won't solve problem, will make it worse - entrench dysfunction deep into code where harder to fix. On flip side, if have culture that already values transparency and inclusion, building tools to make it easier for people with different styles, seniority levels, and geographies to participate reifies that value. Given culture isn't binary, making positive outcomes easiest and default approach creates positive feedback loops. Don't pave unhappy cow paths: teams don't respect each other → microservices won't fix it, teams can't communicate → new tools won't fix fundamental problems, toxic culture → automation won't make it less toxic. Do pave happy cow paths: culture values transparency → build tools making information accessible, culture values inclusion → build tools making participation easier for diverse people, culture values collaboration → build tools making collaboration default/easiest path. Technology should amplify what's working, not try to fix what's broken. Fix culture first, then support it with technology. Tool building culture is still good - but build tools that support good culture, not ones that try to fix bad culture. Key takeaways: (1) Can't solve cultural problems with technology (makes worse, entrenches dysfunction), (2) Can support culture with technology (if culture already values something good, tools reinforce it), (3) Pave cow paths not unhappy cow paths (make good behaviors easier, don't automate bad ones), (4) Fix culture first then support it, (5) Positive feedback loops (making positive outcomes easiest creates reinforcing cycles), (6) Tool building culture still good (but support good culture not fix bad), (7) Microservices example (won't fix communication/respect problems), (8) Transparency example (tools reinforce transparency values), (9) Inclusion example (tools reify inclusion values), (10) Culture isn't binary (technology can help move culture in positive directions).

## Amazon's Leadership Principles

- **Source:** Amazon Jobs
- **Author:** Amazon.com, Inc.
- **URL:** https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles
- **Date:** Current as of 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Leadership principles, organizational culture, decision-making frameworks, operationalized values, Amazon culture, scaling operations, leadership development
- **Key Insight:** The 16 Leadership Principles that Amazon uses every day, whether discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on best way to solve problems. These principles operationalize Amazon's culture - not abstract values but concrete guidelines for how leaders (and all employees) should think and act. The 16 principles: (1) Customer Obsession - start with customer work backwards, earn and keep customer trust, obsess over customers not competitors. (2) Ownership - think like owners, long-term thinking, act on behalf of entire company not just own team, never say "that's not my job". (3) Invent and Simplify - expect innovation and invention, always find ways to simplify, externally aware look for ideas everywhere, not limited by "not invented here", accept being misunderstood when doing new things. (4) Are Right, A Lot - strong judgment and good instincts, seek diverse perspectives, work to disconfirm beliefs. (5) Learn and Be Curious - never done learning, always seek to improve, curious about new possibilities, act to explore them. (6) Hire and Develop the Best - raise performance bar with every hire/promotion, recognize exceptional talent, willingly move talent throughout organization, develop leaders and coach others, invent mechanisms for development. (7) Insist on the Highest Standards - relentlessly high standards (may seem unreasonably high), continually raising the bar, drive high quality in products/services/processes, defects don't get sent down the line, problems fixed so they stay fixed. (8) Think Big - thinking small is self-fulfilling prophecy, create and communicate bold direction, inspire results, think differently, look around corners for ways to serve customers. (9) Bias for Action - speed matters, many decisions reversible, don't need extensive study for everything, value calculated risk taking. (10) Frugality - accomplish more with less, constraints breed resourcefulness/self-sufficiency/invention, no extra points for growing headcount/budget/fixed expense. (11) Earn Trust - listen attentively speak candidly treat respectfully, vocally self-critical (even when awkward/embarrassing), don't believe own hype (body odor doesn't smell like perfume), benchmark against the best. (12) Dive Deep - operate at all levels, stay connected to details, audit frequently, skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ, no task is beneath them. (13) Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit - obligated to respectfully challenge when disagreeing (even when uncomfortable/exhausting), have conviction be tenacious, don't compromise for social cohesion, once decided commit wholly. (14) Deliver Results - focus on key inputs, deliver with right quality timely fashion, rise to occasion despite setbacks, never settle. (15) Strive to be Earth's Best Employer - create safer/more productive/higher performing/diverse/just work environment, lead with empathy, have fun make it easy for others, ask: Are employees growing? Empowered? Ready for what's next? Vision for employees' personal success (at Amazon or elsewhere). (16) Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility - be humble and thoughtful about secondary effects, better every day for customers/employees/partners/world, begin each day with determination to be better, end each day knowing can do even more tomorrow, create more than consume, always leave things better than found. These principles work together and create productive tension: Customer Obsession guides focus, Ownership ensures long-term thinking, Invent and Simplify encourages innovation while maintaining simplicity, Are Right A Lot + Learn and Be Curious + Diverse Perspectives = better decisions, Highest Standards + Bias for Action = high quality fast execution, Think Big + Frugality = ambitious goals with resource constraints, Earn Trust + Dive Deep = credibility through understanding, Have Backbone/Disagree and Commit = strong debate followed by unified execution, Deliver Results = execution focus, Strive to be Earth's Best Employer = people focus, Success and Scale Bring Responsibility = long-term stewardship. Key takeaways: (1) Principles are operationalized culture (used every day for decisions), (2) Customer Obsession is first (everything starts with customer), (3) Ownership mindset (long-term, act for entire company), (4) Invent and simplify (innovation + simplicity), (5) Right judgment through diverse perspectives (seek to disconfirm beliefs), (6) Continuous learning and curiosity, (7) Raising the bar (every hire/promotion raises standards), (8) Unreasonably high standards (relentless quality), (9) Think big (bold direction, thinking small is self-fulfilling), (10) Speed and calculated risk (bias for action), (11) Frugality drives innovation (constraints breed resourcefulness), (12) Earn trust through candor (be self-critical, benchmark against best), (13) Details matter (dive deep, no task beneath you), (14) Disagree then commit (challenge respectfully, commit fully once decided), (15) Deliver results (focus on key inputs, never settle), (16) Be Earth's best employer (lead with empathy, ensure growth), (17) Scale brings responsibility (humble about secondary effects, leave things better).

## Medium's Engineering Values

- **Source:** Medium Engineering (medium.engineering)
- **Author:** Dan Pupius (Founder of Range, previously at Medium and Google)
- **URL:** https://medium.engineering/engineering-values-7143c0db0bd6
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, distributed authority, individual empowerment, engineering culture, team growth, mentorship, diversity and inclusion, leadership, engineering practices
- **Key Insight:** Set of engineering values for distributed authority and individual empowerment. To facilitate distributed authority, need alignment around common values and goals - otherwise regress into command and control systems. As organization grows, values become less obvious and harder to communicate. Values discerned from talking with and observing engineers. Six core values: (1) Professional & personal growth is more important than team stability - fluid organization where engineers work on different parts of product and platforms, roles not static (help people grow and change), engineers have input into product direction and which projects work on. Trade-off: prioritizes individual growth over stable static team structures, recognizes people's interests/skills evolve. (2) Everyone is a mentor; human connection is the path to bringing out the best in people - face-to-face contact with whole team important, every engineer should have regular 1:1s with "manager", peer mentorship promoted and encouraged. Philosophy: mentorship not reserved for seniors/managers, everyone can mentor and learn, human connection essential (direct personal interaction, not just process/tools). (3) Excellent teams require diversity & inclusiveness - diverse team important (gender/ethnicity/personality type/experiences/skills), exposes new perspectives and ideas, balance between continuity and variety with whom you work, cliques and factions harmful and corrosive, give each other benefit of the doubt, always remain civil. Value: diversity essential for excellent teams (not just nice-to-have), different perspectives come from different backgrounds/experiences/ways of thinking, diversity must be coupled with inclusiveness (benefit of doubt, remain civil, avoid cliques). (4) Good leaders are active and supportive - leadership comes in many forms. Support at different levels: junior engineers given adequate support and guidance, mid-level engineers given opportunities that challenge and allow growth (allow them to fail safely), senior engineers have varied opportunities for leadership (people management, technical leadership, product direction). Approach: good leaders active (don't just manage, actively support and develop), recognize different engineers need different things at different stages, leadership not limited to people management. (5) Good engineers are rigorous and resolute - simple is better than clever. Elements: try to be proactive over reactive, value well-communicated critical analysis of solutions, use metrics to make good decisions but aren't beholden to them, don't require consensus but do try to get people on same page. Balance: rigor (well-communicated critical analysis, using metrics) but also resolution (simple over clever, proactive over reactive, get on same page without requiring full consensus). (6) Pursuit of greatness is a virtue - quality and velocity are not diametrically opposed. Elements: technology can enable design that hasn't yet been imagined, design may require technology that hasn't yet been invented, want to pave the way in how engineering teams operate and function, want to inspire other engineering teams, team can be one of the best engineering teams. Aspiration: greatness isn't about perfectionism or sacrificing speed, quality and velocity can coexist, technology and design push each other forward, team can be excellent and inspiring to others. How values work together: distributed authority requires alignment (avoid chaos, need alignment around values/goals), growth over stability creates dynamic organization, human connection enables growth (mentorship not process alone), diversity enables excellence (diverse teams with inclusive culture create better outcomes), supportive leadership enables growth (environments where people grow/fail safely/take challenges), rigor enables quality (good practices enable quality without sacrificing speed), greatness is aspirational (motivates while recognizing quality and velocity coexist). Key takeaways: (1) Distributed authority requires value alignment, (2) Growth over stability, (3) Everyone is a mentor, (4) Diversity and inclusiveness enable excellence, (5) Give benefit of the doubt, (6) Support at all levels, (7) Fail safely, (8) Leadership comes in many forms, (9) Simple over clever, (10) Metrics as tools not masters, (11) Get on same page don't require consensus, (12) Quality and velocity coexist, (13) Technology and design push each other, (14) Aspire to be best, (15) Values are not immutable.

## Lullabot's Engineering Values

- **Source:** Lullabot (lullabot.com)
- **Author:** Lullabot Engineering Team
- **URL:** https://www.lullabot.com/engineering-values
- **Date:** Published on Lullabot website (ongoing)
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, team culture, people-centered engineering, inclusivity, accessibility, learning and sharing, open source, code quality, maintainability, automation, joy in work
- **Key Insight:** Set of engineering values for guiding team work and interactions. Values overlap and expand on Core Values - not a hierarchy or tree - used to ground decisions when solutions aren't obvious or there's conflict. Six core values: (1) People matter more - build systems and processes for people first (systems that burn out teams aren't successful even if on time/budget), tools are means not ends (awareness of limitations), value human safety and security, don't actively harm any group, draw on empathy to build equitably empowering products considering unintended consequences. (2) Cultivate inclusivity - diversity and inclusion have impact on technical level, overarching goal to identify or be experts/advocates for people not directly represented on teams (seek out end-user voice), work towards equitable teams reflecting diverse world, continuously evaluate and respond (missing voices different per project), build accessible products (software should function for everyone), educate clients about accessibility, use accessible tools and language in documentation so differently-abled people can work on both sides of keyboard. (3) Learn and share - work fulfilling because always learning new things, prefer new unsolved problems over applying same solutions, learning and sharing woven through all work day by day, best engineering from sharing and building together as group, embrace open-source software and processes, open code-review keeps innovating and saves reinventing wheel, integrate collaboration into daily work creating space to ask for help and be generous with knowledge. (4) Excellence balances perfect and done - balance between getting things done and architectural zen, consider diminishing returns when solving tricky problems, iterate using real-world feedback and quantitative results (not create in isolation), tactical engineering measures okay (some projects need measures not meant to last), stop and discuss when discover new information, partner with clients to find what works best (not all scenarios ideal). (5) Code for the future - think about big picture before important decisions, good systems last because maintainable and maximize client value, others will inherit work (sometimes "future us"), optimize code for future readers (even if more verbose language, limit uncommon language features), automation gratifying but not always right (can reduce technical debt/make robust/save time but can add complexity/waste time), just because can automate doesn't mean should. (6) Work joy into work - technical challenges as fun puzzles to solve (try things break things try again), come back each day because enjoy tinkering with systems, strive to leave room for joy even with tight deadlines and exacting requirements, joy empowers finding possibilities instead of problems and accepting criticism with open mind, find something to smile about even in extreme challenges (new skill, helpful teammate, wistfully deleting code loved), smile in face of adversity frees finding elegant solutions to toughest problems. How values work together: people-centered (all start with people), practical balance (acknowledge realities, tactical measures okay, perfection not goal), long-term thinking (code for future, sustainable systems), collaboration and sharing (woven through everything), positive attitude (find joy and possibilities). Key takeaways: (1) People matter more than systems (burned out teams = unsuccessful project), (2) Tools are means not ends, (3) Consider unintended consequences (empathy and equity), (4) Advocate for missing voices, (5) Inclusivity is technical (accessibility products/tools/language), (6) Learning woven through everything, (7) Open collaboration creates better engineering, (8) Balance perfect and done (excellence is balance using real feedback), (9) Tactical measures okay, (10) Optimize for future readers (including "future us"), (11) Can doesn't mean should (automation), (12) Leave room for joy (even with tight deadlines), (13) Joy enables elegant solutions (find possibilities not problems), (14) Values aren't hierarchy (overlap and expand), (15) Use values to ground decisions (when solutions not obvious or conflict).

## Figma's Engineering Values

- **Source:** Figma Blog (figma.com/blog)
- **Author:** Thomas Wright (Engineering Manager, Figma)
- **URL:** https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-engineering-values/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, scaling engineering teams, descriptive vs aspirational values, tradeoffs in values, collaboration, mentorship, inclusion, craftsmanship, impact prioritization
- **Key Insight:** Four engineering values codified to scale engineering team while maintaining how they work together. Values are descriptive not aspirational—team "shipped" them believing they already fully embodied them, so values can be used as yardstick for decisions and guide for growth (not forcing function to change). Implicit in each value is a tradeoff—something given up. Generic values like "write good code" do no good because nobody would espouse the opposite. Four core values: (1) Communicate early and often - don't wait until code review to share direction, solving together better than independently, assume best intentions when receiving feedback. Figma is collaboration tool so collaboration-first attitude reflected in how build software. Avoid cloistered genius archetype—team has huge depth/breadth of knowledge, don't want to throw that expertise away. Work not done in vacuum—share design docs/product specs/architecture drawings (in Figma), vet ideas early, spot issues before investing too much time. Normalize enthusiastic sharing of works-in-progress, makes easier to ask for help, creates opportunities for organic teaching/learning. Global maximum comes from ensuring communication happens every step of way (though heads-down approach could work for some projects/engineers). Not dogmatic—sometimes code is easiest way to communicate, quick bug fixes don't need multiple rounds of communication. Receptiveness to input essential—sharing early minimizes cost of shifting direction. Tradeoff: risk of slowed decision-making due to many voices, spend cycles iterating on communication ensuring every voice heard. (2) Lift your team - help others grow, strive to make people feel better not worse, strive to create inclusive culture supporting diverse opinions, be solution oriented. Nuanced wording—not "lift your company" (engineering is long process that must be sustainable, asking team to think of company before themselves can lead to burnout). About fellow engineers—making sure trying not only to be successful yourself but lifting people around you. Means constant learning/mentorship/growth (weekly tech talks, formal onboarding mentorship, encouragement to learn new skills). Governs interactions on basic level—thoughtful feedback delivery (focus on ideas not people, feedback that insults/belittles/talks down not effective), receptiveness to feedback (take ideas seriously no matter who they come from, ensure equal opportunity to participate). Institutional investment in inclusion required (not just individual commitment)—company-wide bias trainings, systemic adoption of learnings, recurring reading group on identity/inclusion/psychological safety, DE&I sub-committee. Solution-oriented retrospectives—remove finger-pointing from picture, talk about problem only in terms of solutions (how fix going forward, how prevent happening again), drive effective learning without making people feel worse. Tradeoff: must constantly work to ensure not becoming conflict-averse (could lead to group afraid to disagree), but intended to encourage thoughtful/respectful/positive relationships whether agreeing or disagreeing. (3) Craftsmanship - when solving problem do so sustainably, always strive to improve process and learn from missteps. Figma is tool people use to get work done, critical part of design process at thousands of companies, responsibility—any bug/outage may stand in way of user getting job done, want to live up to trust users put in us. About thoughtfulness and care—be deliberate about what build and how maintainable/extendable in future. Solution requiring revisiting in month (not scaling, ton of bugs, doesn't support use cases) not useful and generates pain for users. Learn from past mistakes—retrospectives for every project, constantly look for opportunities to improve (even from smooth projects), identify and consciously propagate things that went well. Not perfectionists—some projects like beta versions can be "sustainable" with clear imperfection as long as doesn't get in way of learning, endless polish as unsustainable as none, but pushes to plan thoughtfully and learn from mistakes. Tradeoff: sometimes day-to-day speed (teams can emphasize moving fast over stable/bug-free), but given role Figma plays in users' lives worth it to hold high quality bar, and in long run being thoughtful often reduces complexity of ongoing development. (4) Prioritize impact - can only solve so many problems at once so pick battles, things built with shelf-life in mind and that's ok. Design tooling will never be "solved"—space of interesting problems gigantic, small team competing with companies orders of magnitude larger. What do first? Focus on things that matter most to users (current and future) above all else. Rigorous specificity—how much will feature matter to users and how many? If think past users of today to where want product to grow tomorrow/next month/next year, will those users' needs be met? Rely on concrete data (number of users hitting bug/requesting feature) and qualitative questions (impact on user experience). No bandwidth to spare on projects that aren't most important. Informs how approach projects too—craftsmanship reflects drive to be thoughtful/sustainable, but prioritizing impact ensures don't go too far (don't over-engineer in name of sustainability). Solution lasting year built in week often better than solution lasting three years built in month (example: multiplayer feature rebuilt after year and half using more scalable tech stack—thoughtfully postponing allowed focus on other features and wait to see how necessary that work truly was). Tradeoff: sometimes must pass over more out there/exciting projects (frustrating, every engineer has half-dozen project ideas in back pockets), but value lets explicitly admit most exciting projects aren't most important right now and gives framework to decide when moonshot worth tackling. How values work together: descriptive not aspirational (yardstick for decisions, guide for growth), explicit tradeoffs (makes meaningful), collaboration-first (reflects Figma being collaboration tool), people-focused (lift your team about fellow engineers not company), balance craftsmanship and impact (ensure don't over-engineer), inclusive and solution-oriented, continuous improvement. Key takeaways: (1) Values descriptive not aspirational, (2) Explicit tradeoffs make values meaningful, (3) Communicate early and often (solve together better), (4) Tradeoff: slower decision-making, (5) Lift your team not company (avoid burnout), (6) Thoughtful feedback delivery (ideas not people), (7) Solution-oriented not finger-pointing, (8) Institutional investment in inclusion, (9) Tradeoff: conflict-averse risk, (10) Craftsmanship thoughtful and sustainable, (11) Tradeoff: sometimes day-to-day speed, (12) Prioritize impact with rigorous specificity, (13) Balance craftsmanship and impact (don't over-engineer), (14) Tradeoff: exciting projects wait, (15) Values are starting point not end (roll into interview/onboarding, may keep iterating).

## HubSpot's Engineering Values

- **Source:** HubSpot Product Blog (product.hubspot.com/blog)
- **Author:** Whitney Sorenson (He/Him)
- **URL:** https://product.hubspot.com/blog/hubspots-engineering-values
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, product and engineering culture, speed and scale, customer obsession, AI-first, unified infrastructure, small teams, technical leadership, developer efficiency, throughput over predictability
- **Key Insight:** Values that drive product and engineering teams at HubSpot, organized around what it means to work as engineers and as a product and engineering organization. Focus on speed, scale, customer obsession, and building great teams. Two main sections: (1) As engineers - 9 values: (a) All in on AI from developer tooling to product future, (b) Build software globally distributed at massive scale (hundreds of thousands or millions of people), (c) Invest in unified infrastructure (easy to get started or jump into systems don't directly own, build best in class tooling, most builds through existing stack, focus more on solving customer problems), (d) Favor starting small and learning quickly by shipping (ideation to product in hours or days not weeks, pragmatic about documentation and design practices supporting speed), (e) On-call culture (take ownership of what build, high bar for quality/reliability, sometimes ship bugs but fix quickly), (f) Build with small teams of 3-4 people (clear ownership, focus, move fast), (g) Tech Leads and Engineering Leads are engineers first managers second (hands on with impactful technical work, delegate by default to create strong peer group taking ownership of team responsibilities), (h) Only hire and promote technical engineering leaders (prioritize solving for customer over perfect processes/planning/programs), (i) Invest in developer efficiency (measure developer productivity to improve way work and build great team, small PRs, fast reviews, collaborative teams win). (2) As product and engineering organization - 9 values: (a) Want to win (unique as large fast growing business, ambitious never satisfied, want outsized gains, you'll be pushed sometimes), (b) Work hard and believe in work flexibility and ability to unplug (balance), (c) Build easy fast unified product (help SMBs scale through powerful consumer grade experiences), (d) Obsess over customers (everything should have customer lens), (e) Move fast and take calculated risks (decisions don't require 100% consensus or 100% data, intuition and ownership count for lot), (f) Value throughput over predictability (processes and planning only need to be good enough, low tolerance for bureaucracy), (g) Building great team (help and support each other through questions/challenges/growth, being part of team is part of reason show up each day, build psychologically safe teams, don't tolerate jerks), (h) Want you to grow and own your growth (manager can coach and align opportunities but you in driver's seat), (i) Want to hear your feedback (don't pretend to be perfect or have everything figured out, constantly trying to improve and evolve, you can help shape better future for team and customers). How values work together: speed and scale (start small ship fast, move fast, throughput over predictability), customer obsession (obsess over customers, everything has customer lens, leaders prioritize solving for customer), ownership and responsibility (on-call culture, own what build, own your growth, take calculated risks), practical over perfect (good enough processes, pragmatic documentation/design, sometimes ship bugs but fix quickly), small teams technical leaders (3-4 person teams, technical leaders engineers first, delegate by default), developer efficiency (unified infrastructure, measure productivity, small PRs fast reviews), great teams (psychologically safe, don't tolerate jerks, help and support, own your growth), AI-first and unified infrastructure (all in on AI, unified infrastructure), ambitious but balanced (want to win work hard but flexibility and ability to unplug). Key takeaways: (1) AI-first approach, (2) Massive scale mindset, (3) Unified infrastructure, (4) Start small ship fast (hours/days not weeks), (5) Pragmatic practices, (6) On-call and ownership, (7) Small teams (3-4 people), (8) Technical leaders first (engineers first managers second), (9) Only technical leaders, (10) Developer efficiency, (11) Want to win (ambitious never satisfied), (12) Work hard but flexible, (13) Customer obsession, (14) Move fast take calculated risks, (15) Throughput over predictability, (16) Build great teams, (17) Own your growth, (18) Open to feedback.

## Shields Down

- **Source:** Rands in Repose (randsinrepose.com)
- **Author:** Michael Lopp (Rands)
- **URL:** https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Employee retention, resignation psychology, leadership, team management, values violations, employee engagement, retention strategies
- **Key Insight:** The moment of resignation happens long before someone says "I'm resigning." It happens the instant they let a glimpse of a potential different future into their mind—their "shields" drop. Understanding when shields drop is critical for leaders who want to retain their best people. Key framework: (1) Resignations happen in a moment (not when declared, but when considering alternative), (2) Shields drop when someone lets potential different future into mind (seems unconsidered off-the-cuff thought but opens possibilities that didn't exist moment before), (3) Complex instant mental math precedes shields-down (when asked to lower shields, immediately parse and evaluate: Am I happy? Do I like manager/team? Is project fulfilling? Am I learning/respected/growing? Fairly compensated? Company/team going anywhere? Believe in vision? Trust leaders?), (4) Each human has different prioritized subset (growth paramount for some, truth for others), (5) Final question: What has happened recently or in past that either supports or detracts from what I value? (answer determines whether shields stay up or go down), (6) When someone resigns, ask two questions: Why are they leaving? (rehearsed answers) and When did their shields go down? (real insight), (7) Shields drop when presented with opportunity and they quickly evaluate rubric and make instant call: Is this job meeting my bar?, (8) "When did you start looking?" reveals real moment, (9) Happy people don't leave jobs they love (if leaving, shields dropped), (10) Leader's responsibility: Something nudged them at critical moment (basic values violation that dug in, stuck, festered), (11) Examples of shield drops: project cancellation rumor (wasn't true but too late), promotion rumor via grapevine (got promotion but too late), dismissive answer at All Hands (signal in gossip), (12) Not just boredom (major contributor but list of contributing factors immense), (13) Cost is exponential (departure cost always exponentially higher than minor situation that caused it), (14) Complex problem (strategies to prevent shields dropping as numerous as reasons they drop, even weekly 1:1s with substance don't always catch it), (15) Every moment matters (every moment as leader is opportunity to strengthen or weaken shields). Real examples: "I've been here three years looking for change" → two months ago told project likely canceled (wasn't), "No idea when I'll be tech lead" → heard via grapevine not being promoted (got promotion too late), "Don't believe senior leadership" → blew off question at All Hands with terse answer (forgot signal in gossip). Key insights: The moment of resignation happens long before declaration, shields drop when considering alternative, instant mental math evaluates current job against rubric, values violations (major or minor at wrong time) cause shields to drop, cost of departure exponentially higher than situation that caused it, every moment as leader is opportunity to strengthen or weaken shields, happy people don't leave jobs they love, leader's responsibility when someone leaves (screwed up somehow), strategies to prevent are complex (numerous as reasons they drop), ask "when did you start looking?" to find real moment.

## "Sharing Interesting Stuff" Management Tool

- **Source:** Shipup Blog (Medium)
- **Author:** Florian Fesseler (VP Engineering @ Shipup)
- **URL:** https://medium.com/shipup-blog/sharing-interesting-stuff-a-simple-yet-powerful-management-tool-771d3c2b39b7
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Management practices, 1:1 meetings, relationship building, knowledge sharing, team learning, remote work, coaching, learning culture
- **Key Insight:** A practice for deepening manager–direct report relationships through structured knowledge sharing. The idea: direct report sends resource (blog post, book chapter, video, podcast) and related questions a few days before meeting, discuss opinions and answer questions, then alternate roles next session. Context: After joining as VP Engineering, felt need to create strong relationships and get to know people on deeper level (way we think, what we value, experiences) beyond regular 1:1s, but wanted to accelerate learnings. Framing: Shouldn't cost too much time, remain informal (open discussion, no judgment, no objectives), get to know each other on deeper level. Format: Frequency - bi-weekly alternating roles each session, Duration - 30 minutes no more, Location - office or remote (both work well, good opportunity for remote), Preparation - resource sent at least few days before to have time to think (store resource link and questions on Notion page), Any topic you find interesting. Partially influenced by previous experiment during lockdown inspired by learning practice session from Philippe Bourgau. Examples: (1) Manager → Report: Code Review Pyramid article with questions about model usefulness, what to add to pyramid, what don't check enough. (2) Report → Manager: Scaling Up Sustainable Engineering Processes article with questions about avoiding "too much too soon" feeling, whether processes could have benefited from testing phase. Benefits after few dozen sessions: (1) Sharing related experiences - engineering leader brings experience to company, past experiences help improve or avoid mistakes, interesting to discuss positive/negative sides. (2) Forcing yourself to know more about topic - advantage of sharing in advance is time to read and think, sometimes realize mind not as clear as thought, put ideas in order and dig deeper to come up with clear opinion, feeling of needing to master subject (like teaching or preparing for interview). (3) Bringing topics that wouldn't surface otherwise - usually 1:1 topics are "fresh" ones (last sprint, production issues, recent victories), sharing sessions bring discussions that wouldn't happen because no recent events touched that topic, way to broaden discussions and make them happen earlier rather than waiting for them to appear. (4) Finding out what topics resonate with everyone - alternating roles reinforces informal side putting hierarchical relationship aside, also helps find what topics particularly resonate (which lead to powerful conversations vs. "interesting but not too much to say"), hard to know what caught team's eyes without this practice. (5) Taking pulse of given topic - sometimes practices easy in new environment that were hard before, or quick wins were actually difficult, used practice to take pulse of process improvement/practice/principle/idea that wouldn't be easy to bring, informal discussion with open questions helps evaluate feelings, see precautions to take, or plant seed and see how it grows. (6) Finding coaching opportunities - discussions can lead to coaching opportunity when question doesn't have clear answer or no experience, ad-hoc coaching session focusing on topic. (7) Reinforcing culture of learning & sharing - resources come from reading habits, learning & sharing is pillar of engineering culture (everyone has allocated time), practice reinforces that culture. (8) Works particularly well in remote context - doesn't require specific tooling, basically discussion, well-suited for remote (like virtual water cooler for informal discussions and relationship building). After few dozen sessions value still high - fact that content shared in advance, people prepared, actively try to replan sessions (rather than canceling) says a lot, sessions always enjoyable, sense of serendipity happening. Practice can be done between any level of employee, not just manager–report. Key takeaways: (1) Simple format (send resource + questions, discuss, alternate), (2) Format details (bi-weekly alternating, 30 min, office/remote, few days advance, any topic), (3) Initial objective (deeper relationships, accelerate learnings), (4) Framing (not too much time, informal, open discussion), (5) Eight benefits, (6) Alternating roles (informal, find what resonates), (7) Storage (Notion page), (8) Preparation matters, (9) Indicators of value (replan not cancel, enjoyable, serendipity), (10) Scalable (any level), (11) Cultural reinforcement (learning & sharing), (12) Remote-friendly.

## Good Morning Learning

- **Source:** Philippe Bourgau's XP Coaching Blog (philippe.bourgau.net)
- **Author:** Philippe Bourgau (Software Development Coach)
- **URL:** https://philippe.bourgau.net/growth-mindset-coaching-turn-remote-work-commutes-into-team-learning/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Daily learning sessions, growth mindset, compound learning, remote work, team learning, knowledge sharing, active recall, coaching, habit formation
- **Key Insight:** A daily 30-minute learning session format: 20 minutes studying, 10 minutes sharing. Use remote work commutes as an opportunity to build compound learning habits and coach growth mindset. The format: Every day, study during 20 minutes, share during 10 minutes, invite a guest, split the group when too large. Story: Learning addict demoralized by infinite things to learn, keeping skills up to date crucial for software industry. Inspiration from Woody Zuill's mob programming training - "At Hunters, we started every day with 1 hour of learning." When lockdown hit, commute time went from 50 minutes to 50 seconds - perfect occasion to give daily learning a try. Tech agile coach colleagues started meeting every morning for 30 minutes (20 minutes studying, 10 minutes sharing). Some read books, others looked at articles, others experimented. Week in, everyone got hooked. Part-time coaches started inviting teammates, group grew too large, had to fork and start spin-offs in different teams. Practice has been growing since then. Coaching growth mindset: When coaching team, installing growth mindset is main goal. Good Morning Learning coaches growth mindset in 2 ways: (1) Continuous learning - after few weeks coachees see they can now do things they used not to, with time increases confidence in abilities to overcome challenges, (2) Hacking remote work commutes into learning shows how to embrace change (not only adapt to disrupting constraints but get even better). Using remote work commute to setup compound learning habit is antifragile move. Compound learning: Richard W. Hamming quote from "You and Your Research" - "Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of same ability, one who works ten percent more will more than twice outproduce the other. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime." Compound learning is extra-ordinary (magical) - over long term makes us more productive and keeps bosses happy, higher productivity means more sustainable pace, more sustainable pace is opportunity to have more time to enjoy life. Like compound interests, spending 30 minutes daily learning trains you to learn faster and internalizes knowledge that enables grasping more advanced topics. Coach learns too. How to set it up: (1) Open calendar app, (2) Schedule 30 minutes daily appointment at time you used to commute, (3) Invite coachees and guest. During session: (1) Everyone forks off to study something for 20 minutes, (2) Everyone joins back group after 20 minutes and shares what learned. If too much to share in 10 minutes, split session into 2, every group now has to invite guest. Good Morning Learning is corporate hack - guerrilla coaches with no formal authority can use commute time (no one can justify you should be cranking out features at time you used to commute). Why it works: (1) It's motivating - Daniel Pink's Drive says Mastery is crucial element to intrinsic motivation, growing mastery on your topic before anything else makes every day feel more valuable, starting every work day by studying and growing mastery on topic you care about builds intrinsic motivation. (2) Social pressure - having to share what you learn with teammates adds dash of social pressure, nudges us into using 20 minutes of learning efficiently. (3) Active recall - essential principle for efficient learning (see MOOC Learning how to learn), reformulating for colleagues forces you to organize new knowledge, in end you remember better. (4) Viral hack - rule of inviting someone from another team to session is viral hack, people who tried Good Morning Learning love it and want to continue, most of time they replicate it in their teams when group grows and splits. Win-win strategy: Free in current WorkFromHome context (stick to remote work commutes time and you're safe), sets up compounding learning habit for you and coachees, motivating way to coach growth-mindset. Key takeaways: (1) Format (every day, 20 min study, 10 min share, invite guest, split when large), (2) Opportunity (remote work commutes perfect for daily learning), (3) Coaching growth mindset (continuous learning, embracing change), (4) Compound learning (knowledge and productivity like compound interest), (5) Simple setup (schedule at commute time, invite coachees and guest), (6) Corporate hack (guerrilla coaches can use commute time), (7) Why it works (motivating, social pressure, active recall, viral hack), (8) Growth and replication (spreads organically when groups split), (9) Win-win strategy (free, compound learning, growth mindset), (10) Coach learns too.

## Management Training for Startups

- **Source:** First Round Review (review.firstround.com)
- **Author:** Featuring Melissa and Johnathan Nightingale (co-founders of Raw Signal Group)
- **URL:** https://review.firstround.com/your-startups-management-training-probably-sucks-heres-how-to-make-it-better/
- **Date:** Not specified
- **Key Concepts:** Management training, leadership development, startup scaling, manager development, training programs, organizational development, first-time managers
- **Key Insight:** Why management training matters for startups (despite "hire smart people and get out of their way" quote), when to start (milestones at 40, 70, 120-150, 350 person orgs), 7 common mistakes to avoid (building in-house, only training new managers, siloing by department, minimum viable training, CEOs joining, personality assessments as primary tool, role-playing), and 4 essential modules every manager training should include (goal setting, talent management, employee lifecycle and hiring, leadership & culture development). The problem: Management often falls to back burner at early-stage companies, but many cracks that emerge as startups scale trace back to missing managerial cornerstones - alignment issues, siloing, conflicts between teams, duplicate work. "There are a lot of people who have been given power in an organization, but no training on how to wield that power." Power is weird - being a peer then becoming someone's boss, giving feedback to friend vs. someone you can fire. When to start: Key phrases indicate it's time ("We've doubled in size, but we haven't doubled our output"). Milestones: 40-person (things get harder), 70-person (silos creep up), 120-150 (fractured culture), 350 (more bought in). Warning: "When you're a really small startup, co-founder drama is the likely company-killer. But as your org gets larger, the thing that often tanks the company is waiting too long to bring on competent management." 7 mistakes: (1) Building in-house (startups use someone else's payment provider/CRM, shouldn't build training either, HR presentations get ignored by engineering/sales leaders), (2) Only training new managers (leaves mid-senior/exec under-equipped, new managers bring techniques unfamiliar to bosses, mixed cohorts outperform), (3) Siloing by department (cross-functional leaders talk past each other, training should bolster relationships, not create silos), (4) Minimum viable training/lunch-and-learn (signals org doesn't value management, doesn't provide room for why, Raw Signal works across 6 weeks weekly basis), (5) CEOs joining in (changes dynamic, alters vibe, need safe space for vulnerability), (6) Personality assessments as primary tool (DISC, Myers-Briggs, Strengths Finder, Enneagrams - make others into shallow caricatures, force-fit oversimplifies), (7) Role-playing (awkward, falsified constructs hard to apply, better to create safe space for actual struggles). 4 essential modules: (1) Goal setting - root of management is make team more effective through thoughtful support of creativity and high-trust environment, OKRs/OPSPs/Rocks not about framework but translating strategic vision, build predictive ability (can you stare down next quarter and evaluate if resourced appropriately), emphasize cross-functional work (interesting work at intersection of teams), "The people who will screw you over typically don't work in your department - they don't have same frameworks in their head." (2) Talent management - 1:1s (how often are you surprised? gauge effectiveness), feedback (understand what feedback trying to do, self-assess if useful), DEI needs seat at table (inclusion layer, power and marginalization), firing (recoverable under-performance, PIP graduation, how to know when time, work with HR/Legal). (3) Employee lifecycle and hiring - recruiting takes time, train on working with recruiting counterpart, understand job rec (seniority, comparables, job description), compensation system (when someone asks for raise). (4) Leadership & culture development - values on wall (what do they mean, do we all think same thing, are they real, guidepost for behavior), operationalize culture, comes last (need management skills and shared accountability first), "Are you building the culture we want? Do values on wall reflect real values or different behaviors get promoted?" Training principles: Ground in past experience as direct report (what it felt like to not have power, boss changing mind, boss unavailable), start from philosophical place (why are you here, what do we pay managers to do), multi-week (6 weeks, weekly meetings), mixed cohorts (range of seniority, culturally relevant), cross-functional (bolster relationships), safe space (confidentiality, facilitators go first with vulnerability), credibility (trainers come from doing the work, not just training). Management is totally different role - work expected, problems solving, calendar all different. Need to communicate explicitly when promoting: "This is different role, things that made you successful still relevant, but things that will make you successful are different, learnable but will take work." Key takeaways: (1) Management matters despite quote, (2) Problems stem from under-equipped teams, (3) When to start (milestones), (4) Warning signs, (5) 7 mistakes to avoid, (6) 4 essential modules, (7) Training principles, (8) Management is different role, (9) Power dynamics matter, (10) Mixed cohorts outperform.

## The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience

- **Source:** Elided Branches (elidedbranches.com)
- **Author:** Camille Fournier (CTO, author, member of Apache ZooKeeper community)
- **URL:** https://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/06/the-virtues-of-laziness-and-impatience.html
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Leadership virtues, management practices, work-life balance, burnout prevention, focus, efficiency, process improvement, team scaling
- **Key Insight:** Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris as virtues for engineers (from Larry Wall's "Programming Perl") sustain into leadership. Channeling these traits as advantages: impatience and laziness are wonderful when directed at processes and decisions, not people. As leaders grow, people look to them for behavioral guidance. What to teach: how to focus. Two areas to practice showing: figuring out what's important, and going home. Problem: Watching people waste energy approaching problems with brute force and spending time rather than thought, any culture encouraging excessive hours all the time is doing just that. Value of automation is to make your job easier - engineers automate to focus on fun stuff (uses most of your brain), which you can't do for hours and hours day after day. Be impatient to figure out what's important - as leader, when you see something inefficient, ask: Why does this feel inefficient? What is the value? Can we deliver that value faster? Can we strip down this project into something simpler? Problem with "faster" question: Often managers explicitly or implicitly want to know if team can work harder or longer hours to deliver in fewer days. This is why show value of laziness - "faster" is not about "same number of hours but fewer total days," it's about "same value to company in less total time." If team works 60 hours in week to deliver something that would've taken week and a half, they haven't worked faster, they've just given company more free time. Going home: Go home! Stop emailing at all hours of night and weekend! Forcing yourself to disengage essential for mental health. Burnout real problem in American workforce, almost everyone who worked sustained excess hours has experienced it to some degree - terrible for individuals, families, teams. But not just about preventing your own burnout, it's about preventing team's burnout. When you work later than everyone else, send emails at all hours, even if you don't expect team to respond, they see you doing it and think it's important. That overwork makes them less effective, especially at detailed knowledge work engineers need to perform. Practical tips for new managers: When newish manager and haven't figured out tricks to do job effectively, might need to work more hours for little while - that's ok. But figure out way to work those hours without encouraging team to do so or making them feel obligated to be on your schedule. Queue up weekend and overnight emails for next work day. Put chat status as "away" in off hours. Take vacation and don't answer email during that time. Constantly ask yourself same questions you ask team: Can I do this faster? Do I need to be doing this at all? What is the value I'm providing with this work? The virtuous cycle: Laziness and impatience. We focus so we can go home, and we encourage going home because it forces us to constantly focus. This is how great teams scale. Key takeaways: (1) Laziness, Impatience, Hubris as virtues (from Larry Wall), (2) Applied to processes not people, (3) Two areas to practice (figuring out what's important, going home), (4) Be impatient to figure out what's important, (5) "Faster" doesn't mean more hours (same value in less total time), (6) Go home (stop emailing at all hours), (7) Prevent team burnout, (8) Practical tips (queue emails, set away status, take vacation, ask yourself same questions), (9) Automation to make job easier, (10) Virtuous cycle (focus so we can go home, going home forces focus, how great teams scale).

- **Key Concepts:** Delegation, entrepreneurship, leadership style, building systems, working ON vs IN business, company culture, process, metrics, scaling
- **Key Insight:** Lazy Leadership isn't about being lazy—it's about spending time on what matters and what you're good at, then leaving everything else to your team. Entrepreneurship is really just a fancy word for delegation—continuous process of removing yourself from equation step-by-step. Build a machine (inspired by Ray Dalio's Principles)—think of business as machine you engineer to produce outcomes you want. Work ON your business instead of IN it. Focus on culture, process, and results. The paradox: On paper, terrible CEO (avoids office, rarely starts before noon), but built companies with 200+ employees. So-called laziness is actually huge advantage. The lazy way: First cut out middle man (boss), hire someone to do work while you handle high level stuff, over time hire more people, then managers, then executives, finally can hire CEO to run whole company while you sit on board—you can literally delegate running whole company. The delegation barrier: Some entrepreneurs never break through—try hiring, when person doesn't behave exactly like them, jump in and take over, build muscle memory, convince themselves only they can do things properly. "If your business depends on you, you don't own a business, you have a job." Test: What if you went on vacation for six months? If would fall apart, you've made yourself more important than needed, working IN business instead of ON it. Building machine: Henry Ford didn't build cars, he built factories. Great leader's job is build machine that produces product, not do work itself. Inspired by Ray Dalio (Bridgewater Associates, $150B portfolio, 30-year track record) — secret to success is thinking about business as machine you engineer. Determine result you want, design machine that will produce it, figure out what people you need. If part of machine, think about strengths and weaknesses, replace yourself with someone better suited if necessary. Example: Hates traveling, was limiting factor, swapped others into roles requiring travel, business grew because no longer limiting factor. The MetaLab machine: Framework—requires happy former clients, demand from new clients, talented designers and developers. Machine composed of: HR, Operations, Client Relations, Business Development, Finance. First few years wore most hats (some good at, some terrible at), company chaotic and inefficient. Today only spend time on things good at and nobody else can do—learning about clients and making sure meeting their needs (need to understand what clients want to build machine). Aside from that, could get sideswiped by semi tomorrow and trains would keep running. Hired super talented people better than him at each key role, frees up to focus on important stuff: culture, process, results. Where to focus: (1) Reinforcing culture—spend lot of time thinking about culture and maintaining it as company grows. Culture isn't beer taps or swag, it's framework for decision making. When build framework of values, most questions answerable without your involvement. MetaLab values: Job that doesn't feel like job (freedom and autonomy), focus on craftsmanship (is this best we can do, are we proud), no jargon or buzzwords, no assholes allowed, people over profits, be honest not perfect. (2) Building process—used to hate process (thought kills morale), learned simple unintrusive process key. Creative work doesn't mean no recipe—like bakery hiring bakers and saying "make pies" without recipe, every pie different. Today simple: give team 5-10 questions to answer during each phase before moving to next. Example kick-off questions: What problem is client trying to solve? How does product solve problem? Who is target customer? How different from other products? What do they stand for? What pain points are existing users experiencing? What are users loving? In one sentence, how will we know we've been successful? Like core values, knowing answers gives team framework to answer most important questions. (3) Tracking results—in early days, knew going well if more money at end of month than beginning. Once scale up, bank balance doesn't tell you much. Work quality can decline, morale bad, clients unhappy, staff without work—got pulled into weeds, wasn't watching results. 10 metrics to track weekly: Team Utilization, 30/60/90 Day Team Utilization, Client Net Promoter Score, Team Net Promoter Score, New Business Pipeline, Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Collection Effectiveness, Profit Margin. If metric slipping, know need to work on improving process. Take a step back: Still think about work all the time, still have lot to do, still get stressed and work crazy hours. Difference is working ON business instead of IN it, focusing on things good at while let people good in weak spots do rest. Instead of making pies, writing recipes. Something amazing: When realize don't have to make all pies, realize difference between Fortune 500 and small business isn't all that huge—can design machine, target result, plug in right people, tweak until spits out result you want. Lazy Leadership isn't really about being lazy—it's about spending time on what matters and what you're good at, leaving everything else to team. Thinking of business as machine you design and optimize, instead of becoming worn out cog within. Key takeaways: (1) Lazy Leadership paradox, (2) Entrepreneurship is delegation, (3) The delegation barrier, (4) Test (vacation for six months), (5) Build a machine, (6) Replace yourself, (7) Only spend time on what you're good at and nobody else can do, (8) Three areas to focus (culture, process, results), (9) MetaLab's core values, (10) The difference (ON vs IN), (11) Lazy Leadership isn't about being lazy.

## The Non-Linear Problem of 90% Utilization

- **URL:** https://longform.asmartbear.com/utilization/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Team utilization, capacity management, productivity, context-switching, interruptions, burnout, system resilience, cascading failures
- **Key Insight:** Is everyone working very hard, all the time, and yet accomplishing 1/10th of what it seems they should? 90% utilization is causing more failure than you realize—not just in burn-out, but in productivity and output. Using server utilization analogy: Server at 50% capacity handles spikes gracefully. Server at 90% makes system brittle—normal variations cause failures. Multi-server problem: Even with multiple servers at 70% capacity, when one fails, others must absorb load (105% capacity), causing cascading failures. This isn't really about servers; it's about you and your teams. "Busy" life diminishes productivity. Whole team is hectic yet bringing itself to a crawl. We all have capacity—measured in hours, energy, or focused attention. Life-requests: emails, tickets, leads, co-workers, friends, families. 90% utilization causes failure—not just burn-out, but productivity and output suffer. Twin enemies of productivity: Frequent context-switching and interruption. Work drags out because constantly interrupted. Some work abandoned. Cascading failures: When everyone operates at 90%, inevitable hiccup from one person causes ripple effect that hurts others. Over-capacity people ripple problem to others—cascade like chain reaction. The key word: inevitable. People get sick, die, leave, change, run errands, do unplanned work. True emergencies arise. Can't "architect out" of universe—need to assume variation and interruption. Build resilient systems: Design personal and team work-style to be resilient to variation. Assume interruptions will happen. The ideal: Most of time in safe zone, occasional surges into high gear for short period of time and for good cause (product launch bug fixes, clear-and-present danger rally, fun surges like Hack-a-Thon). The trap: Over-utilization creates needless turmoil and lower productivity, not competitive advantage through higher productivity. Don't fall into the trap—don't let yourself or your team operate at 90% utilization. Key takeaways: (1) Server analogy (50% handles spikes, 90% brittle), (2) Multi-server problem (70% each, one fails = 105% on others), (3) About you and teams (busy = crawl), (4) We all have capacity, (5) 90% causes failure, (6) Twin enemies (context-switching, interruption), (7) Cascading failures, (8) Inevitable interruptions, (9) Build resilient systems, (10) The ideal (safe zone with occasional surges), (11) The trap, (12) Don't fall into trap.
