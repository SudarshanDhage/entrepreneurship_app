# How to Work Faster in a Remote Team

Practical strategies for increasing productivity in distributed teams, based on real experiences from remote-first companies like Zapier.

## The Remote Productivity Advantage

**The fundamental difference:** Non-remote work defaults to the highest distraction communication first, which is in-person. Remote work defaults to the lowest, which is no communication.

"Fewer distractions lead to faster work," explains Zapier co-founder Mike Knoop. "You have to purposely decide to enter into more distracting conversations."

**Core benefits:**
- Fewer distractions (no side conversations, loud music, Nerf balls)
- More to-the-point communication
- Ability to experiment with workspaces, work times, and approaches
- Freedom to work when and where you're most productive

**Important caveat:** Remote work can only succeed in environments that have little red tape and low barrier to decision making. If employees don't have freedom and independence to make decisions, remote work will be less effective.

## Eight Ways to Work Faster in Remote Teams

### 1. Pull Internal Communication Out of Your Inbox

**The problem:** People spend 3+ hours a day on work emails. By default, conversations fall into your inbox and pile up, waiting for you to read and reply.

**The solution:** Take inventory of which conversations belong in your inbox and which belong elsewhere for the sake of context and convenience.

**Example from Zapier:**
- Only two types of internal emails remain: team feedback following group interviews and announcements of new hires
- Company and department updates, project specs, design mock-ups, and "Friday Update" reports moved to private internal blog
- Team feedback, questions, and discussions moved to Slack
- One-on-one email threads replaced with Slack private messaging

**Key insight:** Communication feels cheap to do but often adds up to a lot of time costs. Streamlining communications and cutting down on back-and-forth emails is the true benefit.

**Alternative approach:** Some teams keep email intact but add structure such as advanced Gmail filters.

### 2. Rely on the Right Tools

**The principle:** When your remote team lands on the right tools, you can really get in the groove.

**Master your communication tools:**
- Collaborative editing: Google Docs, Quip
- Project management: Trello
- Team chat: Slack, Flowdock
- Documentation: Hackpad (now Quip)
- Video chat: Lync, Skype, Join.me, VNC
- Progress tracking: iDoneThis

**Key insight from Twilio's Matthew Makai:** "We were more efficient than if we were in-person because we had a mastery over our communication tools. If we were in the same room, I don't believe it would've worked as well because the writing-review-revision feedback loop is inherently asynchronous, so we all worked on our own schedules."

**Microsoft's Scott Hanselman's approach:** "If one tool doesn't work for some reason, don't waste time, just move to the next one."

The time savings might come directly from being remote, but also because you're forced to try new tools that work great remotely and can speed you up.

### 3. Use Differing Schedules to Your Advantage

**Flexible hours for peak productivity:**

**Overcome natural lulls:** IDoneThis founder Walter Chen uses his adjustable schedule to get over his "2 p.m. post-lunch lull." Instead of putting his head down on the desk, he can lie down for a nap or go to the gym for a quick workout, which gives him a huge energy boost.

**Work when you're most productive:** Joe Stych, a Zapier team member, found that at his old job, productivity was zero after 4 p.m.—he was counting down the minutes until he got in his car. At Zapier, he works until he signs off Slack, maximizing his allotted time.

**24/7 development with time zones:** Groove founder Alex Turnbull explains, "We're spread over a number of different time zones all over the world, so our development is 24/7. Even when those of us in the U.S. are sleeping, our developers in Europe and South Africa are hustling. Customers can get help at any hour, and production never stops."

**Handoff advantage:** At Zapier, when it's 8 a.m. in Omaha, it's 8 p.m. in Bangkok. The marketing team hands off pieces at the end of the workday, and when they wake up the next morning, it's all marked up. Never before have editorial teams had this quick workflow.

### 4. Skip the Commute

**Time savings:** "We save, collectively, dozens of hours each week on commuting," says Groove's Turnbull. "Those hours go into getting things done, and over time, that amounts to massive, massive wins."

**Zero friction:** Zapier co-founder Wade Foster explains, "I jump right into work when I'm ready. And leave when I'm done. There's zero friction between working and not."

**Apply the same principle elsewhere:**
- Instead of leaving for lunch, prepare it that morning
- Rather than going for coffee, rely on a thermos or switch to tea
- Cut excess from team processes: Instead of holding weekly stats recap meetings, create an internal blog post that details the numbers

### 5. Cancel Meetings

**The video conference problem:** "Hey, can you hear me?" … "How about now?" The annoyance of fussy software multiplies meeting pain, which is surprisingly helpful—you purposely try to avoid putting yourself in that scenario.

**The solution:** Ask yourself: Do we really need that meeting?

**The payoff:** Start asking this question and you'll start earning back dozens of hours monthly. (One organization in a Bain & Company report identified a potential 7,000 hours saved.)

**Example from iDoneThis:** They reconfigured their weekly meeting after giving it a second thought. Since they didn't set forth a specific enough protocol or purpose, their Hangouts were unfocused, devolved into rambling discussions about product, and ended up wasting time. They changed up the format to a more effective weekly show-and-tell session.

### 6. Think Before You Speak (Send)

**Written communication advantage:** With a majority of communication on a remote team being in written form, you start to notice something: You put more thought into it. It's hard to just spout something out; you first must type it out, read what you've written, and then hit "send" or "publish."

Those extra little steps add a helpful filter to your conversations. You end up thinking before you speak, yielding clearer and more concise communication.

**Amazon's approach (for in-person teams, too):** Jeff Bezos bans PowerPoint presentations in meetings. Instead, he requires each attendee to come prepared with a memo, which is then read by the others before the meeting starts.

"Full sentences are harder to write," Bezos says. "They have verbs. The paragraphs have topic sentences. There is no way to write a six-page, narratively structured memo and not have clear thinking."

**Chat benefit:** Zapier's Foster notes, "Things are more to the point. In-person meetings tend to have lots of chit-chat, how's the weather talk. In chat, you skip over most of that and get right to the point."

### 7. Set Up Your Best Environment

**Jason Fried's insight:** "If you ask people the question, 'Where do you really need to go when you need to get something done?' you typically get three different kinds of answers." One answer is a place, location or room (porch, coffee shop); another is a moving object (plane, train); and another is a time (really early in the morning, weekends).

"You almost never hear someone say 'the office,' but businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office and they're making people go to it all the time. Yet people don't do work in the office."

**The office problem:** The office is where "work moments" happen, not work days. "It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits because you have 15 minutes here, and 30 minutes there and then something else happens and you're pulled off your work."

**Remote advantages:**

**Control your environment:** "Having a quiet day at home to write means I get work done way faster," says content marketer Jimmy Daly.

**Change your surroundings quickly:** "Stand while you work or sit. Kneel at a table if that feels right for a bit. Sit back on the couch to edit or walk around the house with a draft to read over. Use speakers for music if you want…or have perfect silence," says Zapier's Matthew Guay.

**Work from anywhere:** Microsoft's Scott Hanselman explains, "Often just being at home can drive you nuts. I try to get out a few times a week. I've worked from the mall, from Starbucks, from McDonald's (free wi-fi) and from a park bench. I find that just having people walking around makes me feel more productive."

**Zapier's Managing Editor Melanie Pinola:** "When I first started telecommuting, I found myself finishing my tasks much earlier than I had previously and ended up taking on more responsibilities…from home, because I just worked better in this environment."

### 8. Own Up to Your Productivity

**The accountability:** Whether it's working in your own home or a nearby coffee shop, there's another aspect that pushes remote employees to work faster: You're responsible for your productivity. Gone are the regular meetings and brainstorming sessions in "Conference Room 3B," and no more can you pull up a spreadsheet and stare at your screen to appear engulfed in busy work. You now must own up to what you did and didn't accomplish.

**Example from Belle Cooper:** She cut down the time it took her to write a blog post from two days to four hours. She saw Buffer co-founder Leo Widrich churning out posts at a much faster pace, so she examined what could be holding her up. Between cutting out excess research and distractions like email, Cooper eventually narrowed in on how to author a quality blog post in the least amount of time necessary—just one morning.

"Now that I've proven to myself over and over that I can write a post in a morning without dropping my quality, they're a lot less formidable in my mind," Cooper writes. "I think that makes a huge difference to how I work."

**Practical tip from Zapier:** Keep a tally of to-dos on a Trello board to stay focused on what's most important that day. Use automation to copy all the cards in the "done" Trello column to a Google Doc for weekly recaps, cutting weekly recap time from 40 to 20 minutes.

## What Doesn't Work About Remote Work

**Time zone delays:** "There are times, of course, where working together would be faster," says Jimmy Daly. "For example, when we redesigned our site, the process was slowed down by waiting for responses from people who were fast asleep in another timezone."

**Lone remote team member challenges:** Twilio's Matthew Makai finds difficulty when working with a group at HQ while he's remote. "The downside is when I'm working with a group of folks at HQ in San Francisco and I'm in D.C., it's harder to communicate via typical in-person channels such as whiteboards." He circumvents this by visiting the office at least quarterly for in-person meetings.

**Infrastructure issues:** Shoddy internet can give more trouble than in an office building. When the internet's out, productivity takes a hit (though mobile hotspots can come to the rescue).

## The Right Reason to Go Remote?

Whether you're a founder considering going remote or a professional contemplating joining a remote team, a major benefit to consider is the opportunity to amp your productivity.

**You might not need to go fully remote:** Thanks to the rise of instant messaging apps like Slack, collaborative editing tools like Google Docs, and file sharing tools like Dropbox, there's a shift in the way we all communicate at work.

As Scott Berkun, author of _The Year Without Pants_, writes: "Pay attention to how much time you actually spend each day in the same room talking in real time to other people—it's far less today than ever in history. Even in companies that do not allow 'remote work,' remote work is encouraged implicitly by the equipment used and the daily working habits we've adopted across our culture."

## Personal Productivity Tip: Unplug

About six months into the job at Zapier, author Danny Schreiber finally caught up to his new team's fast-paced environment. His trick for writing faster: completely unplug from the communication tools and put 100% focus on writing in a distraction-free environment.

**The lesson:** Sometimes the key to working faster is to pull yourself away from the team and focus completely on the task at hand.
