# Medium's Engineering Values

A set of engineering values for distributed authority and individual empowerment. Values that should influence how engineering teams make decisions and evolve, supporting growth rather than command and control.

## The Purpose

**Dear Medium Engineers,**

We all have value systems: what we hold true, what we consider good, what we consider to be bad. These values define how we respond to situations and how we make decisions.

**The commitment:** Our engineering organization is committed to the notion of distributed authority and individual empowerment; to facilitate this we need alignment around common values and goals. Because the alternative is to regress into command and control systems.

**The challenge:** Given where we live, where we work, and how well we all get on, our values are already likely to be very well aligned. But as we grow this will be less obvious and harder to communicate.

**The values:** This post lays out a set of engineering values that I have tried to discern from talking with and observing you all. They should influence how we make decisions and how we evolve and grow our Engineering Organization.

**They are not immutable, help me refine them.**

## 1. Professional & Personal Growth is More Important Than Team Stability

**The principle:** We want a fluid organization where engineers can work on different parts of the product and on different platforms.

**Key elements:**
- Roles are not static; we help people grow and change.
- Engineers will have input into product direction.
- Engineers will have input into which projects they work on.

**The trade-off:** This prioritizes individual growth and fulfillment over maintaining stable, static team structures. It recognizes that people's interests and skills evolve, and the organization should support that evolution rather than lock people into fixed roles.

## 2. Everyone is a Mentor; Human Connection is the Path to Bringing Out the Best in People

**The principle:** Face-to-face contact with the whole team is important.

**Key elements:**
- Every engineer should have regular 1:1s with a "manager".
- Peer mentorship is promoted and encouraged.

**The philosophy:** Mentorship isn't reserved for senior engineers or managers. Everyone can mentor and learn from others. Human connection—direct, personal interaction—is essential for bringing out the best in people, not just process or tools.

## 3. Excellent Teams Require Diversity & Inclusiveness

**The principle:** A diverse team is important (gender, ethnicity, personality type, experiences, skills, etc), it exposes us to new perspectives and ideas.

**Key elements:**
- We want a balance between continuity and variety with whom you work.
- Cliques and factions are harmful and corrosive.
- We give each other the benefit of the doubt.
- We will always remain civil.

**The value:** Diversity isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential for excellent teams. Different perspectives and ideas come from different backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking. But diversity must be coupled with inclusiveness: giving benefit of the doubt, remaining civil, and avoiding cliques.

## 4. Good Leaders are Active and Supportive

**The principle:** Leadership comes in many forms.

**Support at different levels:**
- Junior engineers are given adequate support and guidance.
- Mid-level engineers are given opportunities that challenge them and allow them to grow; we should allow them to fail safely.
- Senior engineers will have varied opportunities for leadership: people management, technical leadership, product direction.

**The approach:** Good leaders are active—they don't just manage, they actively support and develop people. They recognize that different engineers need different things at different stages, and that leadership isn't limited to people management.

## 5. Good Engineers are Rigorous and Resolute

**The principle:** Simple is better than clever.

**Key elements:**
- We try to be proactive over reactive.
- We value well-communicated, critical analysis of solutions.
- We use metrics to make good decisions, but aren't beholden to them.
- We don't require consensus, but do try to get people on the same page.

**The balance:** Good engineering requires rigor (well-communicated critical analysis, using metrics) but also resolution (simple over clever, proactive over reactive, getting on same page without requiring full consensus).

## 6. Pursuit of Greatness is a Virtue

**The principle:** Quality and velocity are not diametrically opposed.

**Key elements:**
- Technology can enable design that hasn't yet been imagined.
- Design may require technology that hasn't yet been invented.
- We want to pave the way in how engineering teams operate and function.
- We want to inspire other engineering teams.
- Our team can be one of the best engineering teams.

**The aspiration:** Greatness isn't about perfectionism or sacrificing speed. It's about recognizing that quality and velocity can coexist, that technology and design can push each other forward, and that the team can be excellent and inspiring to others.

## How These Values Work Together

**Distributed authority requires alignment:** To have distributed authority and individual empowerment without chaos, you need alignment around values and goals. These values create that alignment.

**Growth over stability:** Valuing growth over stability creates a dynamic organization where people can evolve and take on new challenges.

**Human connection enables growth:** Mentorship and human connection are how growth happens—not through process alone.

**Diversity enables excellence:** Diverse teams with inclusive culture create better outcomes.

**Supportive leadership enables growth:** Leaders who are active and supportive create environments where people can grow, fail safely, and take on new challenges.

**Rigor enables quality:** Good engineering practices (rigor, simplicity, critical analysis) enable quality work without sacrificing speed.

**Greatness is aspirational:** The pursuit of greatness motivates the team while recognizing that quality and velocity can coexist.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Distributed authority requires value alignment** - To avoid command and control, align around common values and goals.

2. **Growth over stability** - Professional and personal growth is more important than maintaining static team structures.

3. **Everyone is a mentor** - Human connection and peer mentorship bring out the best in people.

4. **Diversity and inclusiveness enable excellence** - Diverse teams expose new perspectives; inclusiveness makes diversity work.

5. **Give benefit of the doubt** - Civil, inclusive culture requires assuming good intentions.

6. **Support at all levels** - Junior engineers need support, mid-level need challenges, seniors need leadership opportunities.

7. **Fail safely** - Mid-level engineers should be allowed to fail safely as part of growth.

8. **Leadership comes in many forms** - Not just people management, but technical leadership and product direction too.

9. **Simple over clever** - Good engineering prioritizes simplicity and proactivity.

10. **Metrics as tools, not masters** - Use metrics to make decisions but aren't beholden to them.

11. **Get on same page, don't require consensus** - Alignment without paralysis.

12. **Quality and velocity coexist** - Pursuit of greatness doesn't mean sacrificing speed.

13. **Technology and design push each other** - Technology enables new design; design requires new technology.

14. **Aspire to be best** - Want to pave the way and inspire other teams.

15. **Values are not immutable** - Values should evolve as the organization learns and grows.
