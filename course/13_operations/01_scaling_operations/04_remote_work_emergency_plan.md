# Remote Work Emergency Plan: What to Do (and Where to Start)

A practical guide for leaders who suddenly find themselves managing work-from-home teams. Five key focus areas to maximize stability during an emergency transition to remote work.

## Untangling Remote Work and Forced Work-From-Home

**Important distinction:** Tens of millions of people globally are experiencing a seismic shift in work. Many have been forced into their homes and asked to not only make do, but maintain or increase their productivity.

**It is neither remote work nor an experiment.**

Being forced to work from home during a pandemic restricts all but a handful of remote work benefits. Losing the commute and making synchronous meetings more human are two perks which are felt, but **the heart of remote work remains squashed:**

- The freedom to choose where you work
- The ability to weave life into your work schedule
- The opportunity to optimize your life for something other than proximity to an office

**For leaders:** Be intentional about highlighting this reality. Make a concerted effort to untangle "remote work" from "crisis-induced work-from-home." In asking someone if they would prefer to remain remote forever, clarify that *remote* is fundamentally different than *working from home while quarantined*. Many workers may need assistance to visualize a remote future which is liberating as opposed to isolating.

## Five Focus Areas for Leaders

### 1. Establish a Remote Leadership Team

**The challenge:** Shifting an entire division or company to remote triggers a shockwave of change.

**The solution:**
- Evaluate current managers
- Rally a team of experts who have remote work experience
- Ensure they can communicate nuances and serve as resources
- Document challenges in real time
- Transparently prioritize those challenges
- Assign DRIs (directly responsible individuals) to find solutions

**Executive assistants may take on a more significant role:**
- Functioning as a documentarian in meetings
- Aiding with internal communications cascaded to the rest of the organization

### 2. Establish a Handbook

**Start rudimentary:** This will serve as a single source of truth for more pressing questions. Communicate this company-wide, and update it continually with DRIs for common questions around tools and access.

**Starting point:** This can start as a single company webpage or repository in Notion or similar tools, and will serve you well even after the current crisis subsides.

**The challenge:** One of the most sizable challenges when going remote is keeping everyone informed in an efficient way. Put concerted effort around systematically documenting important process changes in a central place to minimize confusion and dysfunction.

**Key principle:** Working well remotely requires writing things down. For companies who do not have an existing culture of documentation, this will prove to be the most difficult shift.

### 3. Establish a Communications Plan

**Always-on video conference rooms:** Depending on team size, consider an always-on video conference room per team, where team members can linger, or come and go as they please. This simulation helps acclimation, enabling team members to embrace the shift to remote in a less jarring way.

**Why this matters:** It shows intentionality around informal communication—an important element that occurs spontaneously in an office, and needs an immediate replacement in a remote setting.

**Transparency is vital:** Whatever your current view on transparency, leaders should not hold back during this time. It's vital to maintain perspective through this shift.

**Reality check:**
- Everyone reacts to remote work differently
- Not all homes are ideal workspaces
- This can (and likely will) feel jarring
- Team members will expect frequent updates as leaders iterate on their communication plan in real-time

**Communication channels:** Aim to funnel communication into as few places as possible to reduce silos and fragmentation. You'll want to proactively solve for mass confusion when it comes to finding things—policies, protocols, outreach mechanisms, messaging, etc.

### 4. Minimize Your Tool Stack

**Strip down to essentials:** While functioning remotely, strip the tool stack down to a minimum.

**Minimum viable stack:**
- Google Docs (or similar collaborative editing)
- A company-wide chat tool (Microsoft Teams or Slack)
- Zoom (or similar video conferencing)

**If needed:** If your team needs access to internal systems through a VPN, ensure that everyone has easy access, and instructions on usage are clear.

**Documentation culture:** For companies who do not have an existing culture of documentation, this will prove to be the most difficult shift. Aim to funnel communication into as few places as possible to reduce silos and fragmentation.

### 5. Drive Change

**Recognize resistance:** Humans are naturally resistant to change—particularly change that is forced during times of uncertainty or crisis. Leaders will have to meet this reality head-on.

**All-hands approach:** An all-hands approach to recognizing the new reality is advised, and is vital to empowering everyone to contribute to the success of a remote model.

**It's a process, not a switch:** Particularly for companies with a strong "in-office experience" it is vital for leadership to recognize that the remote transition is a *process*, not a binary switch to be flipped.

**Leaders are responsible for:**
- Embracing iteration
- Being open about what is and is not working
- Messaging this to all employees

**Core principle:** Managing a remote company is much like managing any company. It comes down to **trust, communication, and company-wide support of shared goals.**
