# Lullabot's Engineering Values

A set of engineering values for guiding team work and interactions. Values that overlap and expand on core values—not a hierarchy—used to ground decisions when solutions aren't obvious or there's conflict.

## The Purpose

**We are a team with a wide variety of backgrounds coming together to build systems to solve complex problems.** We combine strategy, user interface design, and code, into cohesive software solutions. Together, this work forms a practice of software engineering. You may not think of yourself as an engineer, but what we do at Lullabot collectively is engineering. When we say engineering, we mean *you*.

**These Engineering Values exist to guide our team in the work we produce and the interactions we have with each other.** These values overlap and expand on our Core Values—they're not a hierarchy or a tree. When solutions aren't obvious, or there's conflict, we use these values to ground our decisions.

## 1. People Matter More

**The principle:** We build systems and processes for people first—and if we forget or ignore those people, our systems become a source of dread, rather than a source of delight.

**Key elements:**

- **Projects that burn out teams aren't successful** - A project that launches on time and on budget, but burns out a team, isn't successful.
- **Helping others keeps us connected** - Even when we're separated by great distances.
- **Tools are means, not ends** - We use many tools as a means of communication (instant messaging, project management, version control, peer review). Sometimes these tools can be a blunt instrument for human dialog. We strive to be aware of their limitations and keep in mind they are a means to engage people, not an end in themselves.
- **Value human safety and security** - The work we produce is not separate from the world in which we live. We value human safety and security.
- **Don't actively harm** - While we do not always have direct control over how our work is used, we aim to create products that do not actively harm any one group.
- **Empathy and equity** - We draw on our empathy to build tools and products that equitably empower everyone who uses them, considering the impact of unintended consequences.

**The philosophy:** Systems exist to serve people. If they don't, they become sources of dread. Every decision should prioritize people—the team building, the users, and the broader impact on the world.

## 2. Cultivate Inclusivity

**The principle:** We value diversity and inclusion. Beyond its intrinsic value, inclusion has an impact on a technical level.

**Our overarching goal:** Identify or be the experts and advocates for people who are not directly represented by our project teams.

**Key elements:**

- **Seek out missing voices** - For example, we seek out the voice of the end-user, because client perspectives can sometimes miss key factors that only a user would know.
- **Work towards equitable teams** - So that our work reflects the diverse world we live in.
- **Continuously evaluate and respond** - The voices that are missing are going to be different from project to project.
- **Build accessible products** - We cultivate inclusivity at a technical level by building accessible products because the software we build should function for everyone.
- **Educate clients about accessibility** - Sometimes that means educating our clients about the importance of accessibility.
- **Use accessible tools and language** - We aspire to work using tools that are accessible themselves and seek to use accessible language and technologies in our documentation so that differently-abled people can work on both sides of the keyboard.

**The value:** Inclusivity isn't just about hiring—it's about advocating for missing voices, building accessible products, and ensuring people can work with the tools we create.

## 3. Learn and Share

**The principle:** We find our work fulfilling because we are always given the opportunity to learn something new.

**Key elements:**

- **Work on new, unsolved problems** - We like to work on new, unsolved problems instead of applying the same solutions to the same problems.
- **Learning woven through all work** - Learning and sharing, with ourselves, our clients, and open communities are woven through all the work we do day by day.
- **Best engineering comes from sharing** - We believe that the best engineering comes from sharing and building together as a group.
- **Embrace open-source** - We embrace open-source software and processes.
- **Open code-review keeps innovating** - The process of open code-review keeps us innovating, and saves us from reinventing the wheel.
- **Integrate collaboration into daily work** - By integrating collaboration into our daily work, we create the space for our team to ask for help and to be generous with their knowledge.

**The approach:** Learning and sharing aren't separate from the work—they're woven through everything. Open collaboration, code review, and knowledge sharing create better engineering.

## 4. Excellence Balances Perfect and Done

**The principle:** We find the balance between getting things done and architectural zen.

**Key elements:**

- **Consider diminishing returns** - When we solve tricky software engineering problems, we also consider when we are seeing diminishing returns.
- **Iterate using real-world feedback** - Rather than creating in isolation, we iterate using real-world feedback and quantitative results to evaluate our work.
- **Tactical measures are okay** - Some projects need tactical engineering measures that are not meant to last.
- **Stop and discuss when needed** - Other times, we discover new information, and we need to stop working to discuss the options again.
- **Partner with clients** - Not all project scenarios are ideal, but we partner with our clients to find out what will work best for them.

**The balance:** Excellence isn't perfection—it's finding the right balance between architectural excellence and getting things done, using real feedback to guide decisions.

## 5. Code for the Future

**The principle:** We think about the big picture before making important decisions.

**Key elements:**

- **Good systems last** - Creating a system to solve a complex problem is only the first part of a software project. Good systems last because they are maintainable and also maximize value for the client.
- **Others will inherit our work** - Others will inherit our work and need to improve and maintain it. We don't have perfect memory and know that sometimes the inheritors are just "future us".
- **Optimize code for future readers** - We optimize code for future readers, even if that means using more verbose language or limiting the use of uncommon language features.
- **Automation is gratifying but not always right** - Automating away repetition for ourselves, the community, and our clients is deeply gratifying. Automation promises to reduce technical debt, make processes more robust, and save time and money. However, automation can also add unnecessary complexity and waste time.
- **Can doesn't mean should** - Just because we *can* automate something doesn't mean we *should*.

**The perspective:** Code exists in time. Future readers (including "future us") will need to understand and maintain it. Make decisions with the big picture in mind.

## 6. Work Joy Into Work

**The principle:** As engineers, we have a tendency to look at technical challenges as fun puzzles to be solved.

**Key elements:**

- **Technical challenges as fun puzzles** - We try things, we break things, and we try again. We come back to work each day because we enjoy tinkering with the systems we build.
- **Leave room for joy** - When planning our work, we strive to leave room for joy, even with tight deadlines and exacting requirements.
- **Joy empowers possibility-thinking** - Making room for joy empowers us to find possibilities instead of problems and to accept criticism with an open mind.
- **Find something to smile about** - Even amid extreme technical challenges, we find something to smile about—whether that's a new skill learned, a helpful teammate, or wistfully deleting code we loved.
- **Smile in the face of adversity** - Together, we smile in the face of adversity, freeing us to find elegant solutions to the toughest problems.

**The attitude:** Work can and should have joy. Technical challenges are puzzles to solve. Finding joy—even in adversity—frees us to find elegant solutions.

## How These Values Work Together

**People-centered:** All values start with people—people matter more than systems, inclusivity serves people, learning and sharing happens with people, excellence serves people, code serves future people, and joy is about the people doing the work.

**Practical balance:** These values acknowledge practical realities—not all scenarios are ideal, tactical measures are sometimes needed, automation can be harmful, perfection isn't the goal.

**Long-term thinking:** Code for the future, cultivate inclusivity that reflects the diverse world, balance perfect and done for sustainable systems.

**Collaboration and sharing:** Learn and share is woven through everything—open source, code review, collaboration, generous knowledge sharing.

**Positive attitude:** Work joy into work—find possibilities, smile in adversity, enjoy the puzzles.
