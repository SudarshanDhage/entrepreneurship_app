# HubSpot's Engineering Values

The values that drive product and engineering teams at HubSpot, organized around what it means to work as engineers and as a product and engineering organization. Focus on speed, scale, customer obsession, and building great teams.

## The Purpose

**At HubSpot, our mission is to help millions of organizations grow better.** And our product & engineering teams play a critical role in achieving this mission and solving for the customer. Below are the values that drive our product and engineering teams at HubSpot.

## As Engineers

### 1. We're All In on AI

From developer tooling to the future of our product. We believe it will transform how our customers operate and grow.

**The commitment:** AI isn't a nice-to-have or future consideration—it's central to how we build tools, improve developer experience, and shape the product.

### 2. We Build Software That is Globally Distributed at a Massive Scale

What you build will be used by hundreds of thousands or millions of people.

**The reality:** Every engineer needs to think about scale from day one. What you build will have real impact at massive scale.

### 3. We Invest in Unified Infrastructure

Making it easy to get started or jump into systems you don't directly own. This lets us build best in class tooling, means most of what we build will be through the existing stack, and means we can focus more on solving customer problems.

**The approach:** Unified infrastructure means:
- Easy to get started or jump into systems you don't directly own
- Build best in class tooling
- Most builds use existing stack
- Focus more on solving customer problems, less on infrastructure

### 4. We Favor Starting Small and Learning Quickly by Shipping

Problems go from ideation to product in hours or days, not weeks, and we're pragmatic about documentation and design practices that support our speed.

**The speed:** 
- Problems go from ideation to product in hours or days, not weeks
- Pragmatic about documentation and design practices
- Practices support speed, don't hinder it

### 5. We're On-Call

We take ownership of what we build and have a high bar for quality and reliability. We'll sometimes ship bugs but fix them quickly.

**The ownership:**
- Take ownership of what we build
- High bar for quality and reliability
- Sometimes ship bugs but fix them quickly
- On-call culture ensures ownership and quick fixes

### 6. We Build with Small Teams of 3-4 People

Small teams with clear ownership can focus and move fast.

**The structure:** Small teams enable:
- Clear ownership
- Focus
- Fast movement
- Not large, unwieldy teams

### 7. Tech Leads and Engineering Leads are Engineers First, Managers Second

They are hands on with impactful technical work and delegate by default to create a strong peer group that all take ownership of team responsibilities.

**The leadership model:**
- Engineers first, managers second
- Hands on with impactful technical work

Our leaders prioritize solving for the customer over perfect processes, planning, or programs.

**The standard:**
- Only technical engineering leaders
- Prioritize solving for customer
- Over perfect processes, planning, or programs

- Decisions don't require 100% consensus

## How These Values Work Together
