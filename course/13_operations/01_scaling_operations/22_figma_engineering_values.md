# Figma's Engineering Values

A set of four engineering values codified to scale an engineering team while maintaining how they work together. Descriptive, not aspirational—values the team already embodied, used as a yardstick for decisions and a guide for growth.

## The Purpose

**The challenge:** It can be difficult to scale an engineering team that's executing well. This is a group of people who are doing great work together, but you're going to add more engineers and people will grow and change. Without falling into the "monoculture" failure mode—where you only hire people exactly like yourselves, and where difference is ostracized rather than celebrated—how do you ensure you maintain the important parts of how you work together?

**The solution:** As a solution, we decided to codify our engineering values—how we build products and how we work together. The entire team came together to discuss topics ranging from specific behaviors and individual priorities to team traditions and processes, and even the company's competitive advantages and our hopes for the future of Figma itself.

**The approach:** We strove for values that were descriptive, not aspirational; we "shipped" these believing that as a team we already fully embodied them. Thus these values can be used as a yardstick to make decisions with and a guide for how we want to grow, rather than a forcing function to change ourselves.

**The tradeoffs:** Additionally, implicit in each value is a tradeoff—something that we give up. For each of these values, you could imagine a hypothetical tech company valuing the opposite. A generic value like "write good code" or "try your best" does no good, because nobody would ever seriously espouse the opposite.

## 1. Communicate Early and Often

**The principle:** Don't wait until code review to share your direction; solving something together is better than solving it independently; assume best intentions when receiving feedback.

**The foundation:** Figma is, above everything, a collaboration tool. This collaboration-first attitude is reflected in the way we build software (and of course, our engineering team are extremely active Figma users 🙂).

**The archetype to avoid:** The archetype of the cloistered genius can be tempting—we all want to be the solo rockstar engineer who goes heads down and emerges days later with a perfect solution metaphorically chiseled from stone. But at Figma, we've built an engineering team with huge depth and breadth of knowledge. We don't want to throw that expertise away—hence our first value, communicate early and often.

**Key elements:**

- **Work isn't done in a vacuum** - By sharing design documents, product specs, or even rough architecture drawings (usually in—you guessed it—Figma), we ensure that ideas are vetted early and issues can be spotted and resolved before we invest too much time in solutions that aren't right.
- **Normalize enthusiastic sharing of works-in-progress** - We make it easier for people to ask for help and input when they're unsure how to approach a problem, as well as create opportunities for organic teaching and learning—for the benefit of the person sharing as well as the people being shared with.
- **Global maximum comes from communication** - There undeniably exist projects and engineers where the heads-down approach could work; but the global maximum comes from ensuring communication happens every step of the way.
- **Not dogmatic about process** - Sometimes code is the easiest and most effective way to communicate or discuss an idea. And of course when fixing a bug or throwing together a quick, obvious change, we don't invest the time in multiple rounds of communication beforehand.
- **Receptiveness to input** - Communicating early and often only works if we're serious about being receptive to input. By ensuring that we're sharing early, we minimize the cost of shifting direction.

**The tradeoff:** By living this value, we trade off the risk of slowed decision-making due to a large number of voices in the room. It is not always easy for a large group of people to discuss and have equal say in making decisions. This value pushes us to not only communicate as broadly as possible but also to take all feedback seriously, which can lead us to spend many cycles iterating on communication and ensuring every voice is heard.

## 2. Lift Your Team

**The principle:** Help others grow; strive to make people feel better, not worse; strive to create an inclusive culture supporting diverse opinions; be solution oriented.

**The foundation:** Software engineering is not a single player activity. At Figma, we've been fortunate to build a culture based on strong, respectful, positive relationships and early values discussions focused on how we build and maintain those relationships.

**The nuance:** More than the other values, the wording here is nuanced; it's not "lift your company." Engineering is a long process that must be sustainable and asking an engineering team to think of the company before themselves can lead to burnout. Instead, lifting your team is about your fellow engineers—making sure that you're trying not only to be successful yourself, but that you're lifting the people around you as you do so.

**Key elements:**

- **Constant learning, mentorship and growth** - Weekly tech talks, formal on-boarding mentorship and even simple encouragement to learn new skills have been a staple of Figma's engineering team for as long as anyone can remember.
- **Thoughtful feedback delivery** - As a result of our emphasis on communicating early and often, we frequently find ourselves in the position of giving feedback to each other. This value describes norms that ensure feedback is thoughtfully delivered and focuses on ideas, not people; feedback that insults someone, belittles their work, or talks down is not effective feedback at all.
- **Receptiveness to feedback** - Taking ideas seriously, no matter who they come from, and working to make sure everyone has equal opportunity to participate in conversations—means that we get the best outcomes (in addition to making sure that everyone is welcome in our engineering team).
- **Institutional investment in inclusion** - Ensuring that everyone, no matter their identity or background, is welcome at our company requires institutional investment, not just individual commitment. We hold company-wide initiatives like bias trainings and try to systemically adopt learnings from them into our processes. We have a recurring reading group focused on topics of identity, inclusion and psychological safety.
- **Solution-oriented retrospectives** - Especially when examining a problem—a project that came in late, an outage, a serious bug—it's easy and sometimes cathartic to fall into finger-pointing mode. But by removing finger-pointing from the picture, and talking about the problem only in terms of solutions—how do we fix the issue going forward, how do we prevent this from happening again—we can drive effective learning without making people feel worse.

**The tradeoff:** What we trade off by living this value is having to constantly work to ensure we're not becoming conflict-averse. Taken to its extreme, this value could lead to a group of people who are afraid to disagree with each other on anything. Some engineering cultures, concerned about this failure mode, attempt to drive in the opposite direction by encouraging head-to-head confrontation. But this value is intended to encourage thoughtful, respectful, positive relationships with each other, whether we agree or disagree.

## 3. Craftsmanship

**The principle:** When solving a problem, do so sustainably; always strive to improve our process and learn from missteps.

**The foundation:** Figma is a tool that people use to get work done—we're a critical part of the design process at thousands of companies around the world, including some of the largest and most fast-moving companies in a variety of industries. This is exciting to be a part of, but more than anything for the engineering team it's a responsibility. Any bug—any outage is something that may stand firmly in the way of a user getting their job done, and we want to live up to the trust that our users put in us and do our absolute best to ensure they stay productive.

**The meaning:** Craftsmanship is about thoughtfulness and care in the work we do. It means being deliberate about what we build and how possible it will be to maintain and extend in the future.

**Key elements:**

- **Deliberate and maintainable** - A solution that will require revisiting in a month—because it's not scaling, because it has a ton of bugs, because it doesn't support all the use cases it needs to—is not useful to us and ultimately will generate pain for our users.
- **Learn from past mistakes** - We do retrospectives for every project, to ensure we're constantly looking for opportunities to improve (even from projects that went smoothly) and so we can identify and consciously propagate those things that went well.
- **Not perfectionists** - Some projects, like a beta version of a feature we expect to change heavily before releasing to the public at large, can be "sustainable" even with clear imperfection as long as it doesn't get in the way of what we're trying to learn from the beta. And even for final products, endless polish is as unsustainable as none. But this value pushes us to plan thoughtfully and ensure we learn from our mistakes.

**The tradeoff:** What we trade off by living this value is (sometimes) day-to-day speed. It's easy to imagine an engineering team that emphasizes moving fast over keeping things stable and bug-free—like a team building a product that isn't responsible for important user data and doesn't support anyone's livelihood. But given the role the Figma product plays in the lives of our users, we feel it's worth it to ensure we hold a high quality bar for them. And in the long run, being thoughtful about how we build often reduces the complexity of ongoing development and new features regardless.

## 4. Prioritize Impact

**The principle:** We can only solve so many problems at once, so pick your battles; things are built with a shelf-life in mind and that's ok.

**The context:** It's well believed on the Figma team that design tooling will never be "solved"; the space of interesting problems to solve is gigantic (as a quick perusal of the "Feature Requests" section in the Figma Spectrum community will attest). Furthermore, we're a small team, competing with companies staffed with orders of magnitude more employees than us.

**The question:** What do we do first? Our final value, prioritize impact, reflects our drive as a team to focus on the things that matter the most to our users (current and future) above all else.

**Key elements:**

- **Rigorous specificity** - Prioritizing impact is something that just about every tech company will do—it's hard to find a company (outside of perhaps research divisions) that decides to work on projects with no regard to what impact they'll have. But it's something we do with rigorous specificity.
- **Concrete data and qualitative questions** - How much will this feature matters to users, and how many of them? If we think past our users of today to where we want to see the Figma product grow tomorrow, next month, or next year, will those users' needs be met? We tend to rely on concrete data—e.g., the number of users hitting a specific bug or requesting a feature—but also on qualitative questions like impact on user experience.
- **No bandwidth to spare** - With an engineering team that comfortably fits around a table and all know each others' names and faces, we don't have the bandwidth to spare on projects that aren't the most important thing to be doing.
- **Balances with craftsmanship** - Our third value, craftsmanship, reflects our drive to be thoughtful and sustainable in how we build. But prioritizing impact ensures that we don't go too far—that is, we don't over-engineer in the name of sustainability. A solution that will last a year, and be built in a week, is often better than a solution that will last three years and be built in a month.

**The tradeoff:** As with all values, there's trade offs. Sometimes, we have to pass over the more out there and exciting projects, which can be undeniably frustrating. It is probably not an exaggeration to say that every engineer has half-a-dozen project ideas in their back pockets they'd love to work on—this is what made our Maker Week this past summer so fruitful! This value lets us explicitly admit that sometimes the most exciting projects aren't the most important right now and gives us a framework to decide when a moonshot is worth tackling.

## How These Values Work Together

**Descriptive, not aspirational:** These values describe how the team already works—they're a yardstick for decisions and a guide for growth, not a forcing function to change.

**Explicit tradeoffs:** Each value has an implicit tradeoff—something given up. This makes the values meaningful (unlike generic values everyone would espouse).

**Collaboration-first:** Communicate early and often reflects Figma being a collaboration tool—this attitude is reflected in how they build software.

**People-focused:** Lift your team is about fellow engineers, not the company—prioritizing each other's success and happiness to avoid burnout.

**Balance craftsmanship and impact:** Craftsmanship ensures quality and sustainability; prioritize impact ensures we don't over-engineer. A solution that lasts a year and is built in a week is often better than one that lasts three years and is built in a month.

**Inclusive and solution-oriented:** Lift your team emphasizes inclusion, thoughtful feedback, and solution-oriented problem-solving (no finger-pointing).

**Continuous improvement:** Craftsmanship means learning from mistakes; communicate early and often means sharing early to minimize cost of shifting direction.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Values are descriptive, not aspirational** - Ship values believing the team already embodies them; use as yardstick for decisions and guide for growth.

2. **Explicit tradeoffs make values meaningful** - Each value should have an implicit tradeoff; generic values everyone would espouse aren't useful.

3. **Communicate early and often** - Don't wait until code review; solving together is better than solving independently; share works-in-progress enthusiastically.

4. **Tradeoff: slower decision-making** - More voices in the room can slow decisions; worth it for better solutions and knowledge sharing.

5. **Lift your team, not your company** - Focus on fellow engineers' success and happiness to avoid burnout; help others grow.

6. **Thoughtful feedback delivery** - Focus on ideas, not people; feedback that insults or belittles isn't effective.

7. **Solution-oriented, not finger-pointing** - Remove finger-pointing from retrospectives; focus on solutions, not blame.

8. **Institutional investment in inclusion** - Requires company-wide initiatives, not just individual commitment.

9. **Tradeoff: conflict-averse risk** - Must work to ensure not becoming afraid to disagree; encourage thoughtful, respectful relationships whether agreeing or disagreeing.

10. **Craftsmanship: thoughtful and sustainable** - Be deliberate about maintainability; learn from mistakes; not perfectionists, but plan thoughtfully.

11. **Tradeoff: sometimes day-to-day speed** - Worth it for quality bar and long-term complexity reduction.

12. **Prioritize impact with rigorous specificity** - Use concrete data and qualitative questions; no bandwidth for projects that aren't most important.

13. **Balance craftsmanship and impact** - Don't over-engineer; a solution lasting a year built in a week often better than one lasting three years built in a month.

14. **Tradeoff: exciting projects wait** - Sometimes must pass over exciting projects; gives framework to decide when moonshots are worth tackling.

15. **Values are starting point, not end** - Roll into interview and onboarding processes; learn what they do and don't represent; may keep iterating.
