# Follow Culture First, Don't Start by Changing It

Start with small processes that eventually lead to cultural change, rather than trying to change the culture directly. For middle management, following the culture is the path of least resistance to achieve your goals.

## The Core Problem

When I became a manager, I understood the importance of a great culture. Yet, I had a hard time describing what's culture, what's a great culture, and how to make actionable actions to influence it for the better.

**What people mean by culture:** When I ask people what's company culture for them, it usually reduces to: Company culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and practices that define how a business operates and how its employees interact.

**Long story short:** How decisions are made.

## Understanding Culture Through Seven Dimensions

Based on Tanya Reilly's "The Staff Engineer's Path," when people ask about culture, they might refer to:
- How much autonomy will I have?
- Will I feel included?
- Will it be safe to make mistakes?
- Will I be part of the decisions that affect me?
- How difficult will it be to make progress on my projects?
- Are people nice?

**We can say that our culture is:** How we behave in our day to day, how we make decisions, and based on which values.

Tanya provides 7 dimensions in which you can describe the company's, business unit, tribe, or team culture:

### 1. Secret vs. Open

**How much does everyone know?**
- Information is currency?
- Calendars are private?
- Slack channels are invitation only?
- Does everyone have access to everything?
- Even messy first drafts?

### 2. Oral vs. Written

**What gets shared by word of mouth, and what gets shared written down?**
- How much writing and review is involved in decisions?
- Features come with formal specifications, or you need to go to the person that made the feature?

### 3. Top-down vs. Bottom-up

**Where do initiatives come from?**
- A completely bottom-up culture is one where employees and teams feel empowered to make their own decisions and champion the initiatives they think are important.
- But, when those initiatives need support, they slow down.

### 4. Fast vs. Deliberate

- Rapid decisions and pivot abruptly to try a new opportunity.
- Or you need to show that you've thought through the whole plan before start executing?

### 5. Back channels vs. Front doors

**How do people in different groups talk to each other?**
- Formal path of communication, via the teams' managers for example, or people can send friendly DMs cross teams?

### 6. Allocated vs. Available

**How much time does everyone have?**
- Are teams understaffed or overworked?
- Are you able to absorb new work as they appear, or does it end in the backlog and needs to get prioritized in the next cycle? (it can mean next quarter OKRs review)

### 7. Liquid vs. Crystallized

**Where do power, status, and reputation come from?**
- How do you gain trust?
- Clear hierarchy? Are you in a specific point in the hierarchy, and as others move up into the latter, you also move?
- Or you are more Liquid, where it offers room for change and you need to move yourself to be promoted in the organization?

**Using these dimensions:** I use these 7 dimensions a lot to understand my clients company's culture, and why they are struggling to drive the needed change.

## Understand Your Company's Culture First

**The common responses:** As part of my coaching and consulting engagements, I ask leaders which is their company culture based on those dimensions. Interestingly, I receive kind of two main responses:

1. _That's not the type of company I want to be part of._
2. _That's why we're not able to drive the necessary change, because the culture isn't helping us, we need to change it first so that we can do the necessary changes later_

**Culture is nuanced:** Culture is never black or white, but a grey scale in multiple levels. Plus, I'm sure that you will describe your company's culture differently if I ask you for the overall company culture, your tribe's, or your team's.

**Two scenarios for improving culture:**
- **C-level**, like CTO or CIO.
- **Middle management**, such as VPs or Heads of Engineering, Engineering Managers, or technical leaders like Staff or Principal Engineers.

**This article focuses on middle management:** In this article, I focus on the group that driving a company cultural change is more challenging, the middle management.

**The key insight:** Aiming to drive a company cultural change as a middle management is a recipe for burnout.

## The Middle Management Challenge

**Culture as a blocker, not a goal:** When I talk to middle managers and Principal Engineers about their challenges, they often aren't about culture as their challenge or goal that they want to accomplish, but as a blocker to achieve the desired outcome.

**The typical conversation:**
- Principal engineer: I want to drive this initiative to accomplish A, but it would be easier if we had a more Y culture. How can I influence my leadership to change this culture so that I can accomplish the other thing?

**The answer:** Well, you don't aim to change the culture. Cultural change takes time, requires constant leadership support, and a lot of patience. By the time you achieved that, the challenge you have now will no longer matter. **Instead, follow the culture. It is the path for less resistance to achieve what you aim to achieve.**

**If your approach doesn't fit:** If the approach, plan, strategy, you name it, isn't possible due to the company's cultural restrictions. Then the problem is your approach that's not possible in that context. You need to find another way that fits into the company's culture way of working.

**What this might mean:**
- Yes, it can mean that you need to play the company's rules like being in the right meetings, with the right people.
- It can even mean that you need to move into the management career to influence the decisions where it happens. Not everyone wants to do it, but some has to.

**The approach:** Focus on achieving your goals and overcoming your challenges within the scope of action you have first. Once you are in the middle of the progress, aim to influence the culture as part of journey.

## Cultural Change Is Part of the Process

**The best way to influence culture:** The best way to influence your company culture is part of succeeding in high stake business challenges. You shouldn't aim for a highly disruptive new way of working for the company, but "the adjacent possible."

**Example approach:** If you are part of an organization with a top-down approach, secretive, and oral based communication, you can start influencing the company's culture by driving your initiative by making the information available and written. But keeping the approach top-down. You don't want to change too many ways of doing stuff at the same time.

### When You Succeed

1. **Achieve your business objectives first**, delivering company and customer value.
2. You **create trust** between the all parties. High level leadership, and teams.
3. You show that by doing X, Y, Z, you achieved your objectives. **Company's love success, and we all try to repeat success**. By doing so, the next time you face a similar challenge, **the default approach will be the new ways of working**.

### When You Fail

1. **You learn why you failed**. You don't blame the culture, but understand why that approach didn't succeed. Then you adapt your methods, and try new approaches.
2. You **don't create high resistance to change** due to disruptive new ways of working. That can prevent any new improvement initiatives in the future.
   - The worse that can happen is that the people stop believing in the change.

## Make It Iterative. One Step at a Time

**The principle:** Don't try to change everything at once. Make small, incremental changes that fit within the existing culture. As you succeed with these changes, they become the new default, gradually shifting the culture.

**The adjacent possible:** Aim for the "adjacent possible" - changes that are one step away from where you are, not massive disruptions. This reduces resistance and increases your chances of success.

**The iterative approach:**
1. Understand your culture using the 7 dimensions
2. Identify the smallest change that moves you toward your goal
3. Make that change within the existing cultural constraints
4. Succeed or learn from failure
5. Repeat with the next adjacent change

## Key Takeaways

1. **Culture is how decisions are made** - understand it first before trying to change it.

2. **Use the 7 dimensions** to map your organization's culture: Secret vs. Open, Oral vs. Written, Top-down vs. Bottom-up, Fast vs. Deliberate, Back channels vs. Front doors, Allocated vs. Available, Liquid vs. Crystallized.

3. **For middle management, follow the culture first** - aiming to drive cultural change directly is a recipe for burnout.

4. **If your approach doesn't fit, the problem is your approach** - find another way that fits the company's culture.

5. **Cultural change happens through success** - influence culture by succeeding in high-stake business challenges using new ways of working.

6. **Aim for the adjacent possible** - make small, incremental changes rather than disruptive transformations.

7. **Make it iterative** - one step at a time, building on each success.

8. **Success creates trust and new defaults** - when companies see success with new approaches, they become the default for future challenges.

9. **Failure is learning, not blame** - understand why approaches fail and adapt, don't blame the culture.

10. **Avoid creating resistance** - disruptive changes can prevent future improvement initiatives.
