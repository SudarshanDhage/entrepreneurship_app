# Amazon's Leadership Principles

The 16 Leadership Principles that Amazon uses every day, whether discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on the best way to solve a problem. These principles operationalize Amazon's culture and guide decision-making at all levels.

## Introduction

**How they're used:** We use our Leadership Principles every day, whether we're discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on the best way to solve a problem. It's just one of the things that makes Amazon peculiar.

**Purpose:** These principles operationalize Amazon's culture - they're not abstract values, but concrete guidelines for how leaders (and all employees) should think and act.

## The 16 Leadership Principles

### 1. Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

**Key elements:**
- Start with customer, work backwards
- Earn and keep customer trust
- Obsess over customers (not just pay attention to competitors)

### 2. Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

**Key elements:**
- Think like owners
- Long-term thinking (don't sacrifice long-term for short-term)
- Act on behalf of entire company, not just own team
- Never say "that's not my job"

### 3. Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

**Key elements:**
- Expect innovation and invention
- Always find ways to simplify
- Externally aware, look for ideas everywhere
- Not limited by "not invented here"
- Accept being misunderstood when doing new things

### 4. Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**Key elements:**
- Strong judgment and good instincts
- Seek diverse perspectives
- Work to disconfirm beliefs (actively seek to be wrong)

### 5. Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**Key elements:**
- Never done learning
- Always seek to improve
- Curious about new possibilities
- Act to explore them

### 6. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

**Key elements:**
- Raise performance bar with every hire/promotion
- Recognize exceptional talent
- Willingly move talent throughout organization
- Develop leaders and coach others
- Invent mechanisms for development

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

**Key elements:**
- Relentlessly high standards (may seem unreasonably high)
- Continually raising the bar
- Drive high quality in products, services, processes
- Defects don't get sent down the line
- Problems fixed so they stay fixed

### 8. Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**Key elements:**
- Thinking small is self-fulfilling prophecy
- Create and communicate bold direction
- Inspire results
- Think differently
- Look around corners for ways to serve customers

### 9. Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**Key elements:**
- Speed matters
- Many decisions are reversible
- Don't need extensive study for everything
- Value calculated risk taking

### 10. Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

**Key elements:**
- Accomplish more with less
- Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, invention
- No extra points for growing headcount, budget, fixed expense

### 11. Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

**Key elements:**
- Listen attentively, speak candidly, treat respectfully
- Vocally self-critical (even when awkward/embarrassing)
- Don't believe own hype (body odor doesn't smell like perfume)
- Benchmark against the best

### 12. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

**Key elements:**
- Operate at all levels
- Stay connected to details
- Audit frequently
- Skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ
- No task is beneath them

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

**Key elements:**
- Obligated to respectfully challenge when disagreeing
- Even when uncomfortable or exhausting
- Have conviction, be tenacious
- Don't compromise for social cohesion
- Once decided, commit wholly

### 14. Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

**Key elements:**
- Focus on key inputs
- Deliver with right quality, timely fashion
- Rise to occasion despite setbacks
- Never settle

### 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

**Key elements:**
- Create safer, more productive, higher performing, diverse, just work environment
- Lead with empathy
- Have fun, make it easy for others to have fun
- Ask: Are employees growing? Empowered? Ready for what's next?
- Vision for employees' personal success (at Amazon or elsewhere)

### 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

**Key elements:**
- Success and scale bring responsibility
- Be humble and thoughtful about secondary effects
- Better every day for customers, employees, partners, world
- Begin each day with determination to be better
- End each day knowing can do even more tomorrow
- Create more than consume
- Always leave things better than found

- **Are Right, A Lot** + **Learn and Be Curious** + **Seek Diverse Perspectives** = better decisions
- **Insist on Highest Standards** + **Bias for Action** = high quality fast execution
- **Think Big** + **Frugality** = ambitious goals with resource constraints

- **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit** = strong debate followed by unified execution
- **Deliver Results** = execution focus
