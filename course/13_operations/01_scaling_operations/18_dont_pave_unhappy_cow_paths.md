# Don't Pave the Path Used by the Unhappy Cows

You can't solve your cultural problems with technology, but you can support your culture with technology. Pave the cow paths—just don't pave the paths used by the unhappy cows.

## The Core Insight

**The mantra:** "Let's not solve cultural problems with technology."

**The apparent contradiction:** This runs exactly counter to one of my other philosophies of team, namely: **Be a tool building culture.**

**The nuance:** You can't solve your cultural problems with technology, but **you can support your culture with technology.**

## You Can't Solve Cultural Problems with Technology

**The example:** If your teams don't respect each other and can't communicate, a microservices architecture that decouples deploys isn't going to solve your problem, it's going to make it worse. Its going to entrench your dysfunction deep into your code where it is harder to fix.

**The principle:** Technology can't fix broken culture. If teams have fundamental problems with respect, communication, or collaboration, adding technology will only:
- Make the problems worse
- Entrench dysfunction in code
- Make problems harder to fix later

## You Can Support Culture with Technology

**The positive example:** On the flip side if you have a culture that already values transparency and inclusion, than building tools to make it easier for people with different styles, levels of seniority, and in different geographies to participate in conversations reifies that value.

**Making positive outcomes the default:** And given that culture isn't a binary, making positive outcomes the easiest and default approach creates positive feedback loops.

**The principle:** Technology can amplify and reinforce good culture. If you already have healthy cultural values, tools can:
- Make it easier to live those values
- Reinforce positive behaviors
- Create positive feedback loops
- Make good outcomes the default path

## The Cow Path Analogy

**The summary:** Which was succinctly summarized by one of the people I was talking to as: **"Pave the cow paths, just don't pave the paths used by the unhappy cows."**

**What this means:**
- **Pave the cow paths** - Use technology to make the good paths (healthy cultural behaviors) easier and more efficient
- **Don't pave the unhappy cow paths** - Don't use technology to automate or entrench unhealthy behaviors and cultural problems

**The key distinction:** Technology should amplify what's working, not try to fix what's broken. Fix the culture first, then support it with technology.

## The Relationship to Tool-Building Culture

**Be a tool building culture:** One of my other philosophies of team is to "Be a tool building culture" - building tools to solve problems and make work better.

**The synthesis:** These two ideas work together:
- **Don't use technology to solve cultural problems** - Fix the culture directly
- **Do use technology to support good culture** - Build tools that reinforce healthy values and behaviors
- **Be a tool building culture** - But build tools that support your culture, not ones that try to fix cultural problems

## Examples

**Don't pave unhappy cow paths:**
- Teams don't respect each other → Microservices won't fix it, will entrench dysfunction
- Teams can't communicate → New communication tools won't fix fundamental communication problems
- Toxic culture → Automation won't make it less toxic, might make it worse

**Do pave the happy cow paths:**
- Culture values transparency → Build tools that make information easily accessible
- Culture values inclusion → Build tools that make it easier for people with different styles, seniority levels, and geographies to participate
- Culture values collaboration → Build tools that make collaboration the default and easiest path

## Key Takeaways

1. **You can't solve cultural problems with technology** - Technology will make them worse and entrench dysfunction in code.

2. **You can support culture with technology** - If culture already values something good, tools can reinforce it.

3. **Pave the cow paths, not the unhappy cow paths** - Make good behaviors easier, don't automate bad ones.

4. **Fix culture first, then support it** - Address cultural problems directly before trying to support with technology.

5. **Positive feedback loops** - Making positive outcomes the easiest and default approach creates reinforcing cycles.

6. **Tool building culture is still good** - But build tools that support good culture, not ones that try to fix bad culture.

7. **The microservices example** - If teams don't respect each other and can't communicate, microservices will make it worse, not better.

8. **The transparency example** - If culture values transparency, tools that make information accessible reinforce that value.

9. **The inclusion example** - Tools that make it easier for diverse people to participate reify inclusion values.

10. **Culture isn't binary** - Technology can help move culture in positive directions by making good behaviors easier.
