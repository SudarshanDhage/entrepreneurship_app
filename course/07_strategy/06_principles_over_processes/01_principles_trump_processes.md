# Principles Trump Processes

If you want to last longer in a field with respect, focus on fundamental principles governing it. Don't copy the visible at the cost of the principles.

## The Photography Lesson

**The novice mistake:** Photography is a hobby for me. As a novice photographer, I believed the camera makes the photo. Whenever I met a fellow hobby photographer, I would discuss things related to photography, but mostly would gravitate to cameras. That was until I stumbled on Sephi. He shoots exquisite photos on an iPhone, debunking the myth that the "camera makes the photo."

**The visible vs. the fundamental:** Camera, lenses, bags, and filters are the visible parts of photography, and they are easy to debate, discuss, and dissect. Learning the fundamentals of lighting, composition, and creativity is the hardest, so many photographers are not interested in them.

## Are You Guilty of This?

**The test:** If you think you are unaffected by the pretentious veneer in your industry, you may be unaware of your biases, like I was.

**Common mistakes:**

* Do you focus on fonts and colors on your website instead of content on the pages?
* Are you rolling out Jira (or Basecamp) without first training your team on basics of project management?
* Is your dress-shelf full of turtlenecks because Steve Jobs wore them?
* As a startup founder, are you focused on tuning your logo instead of finding product-market fit?
* Are you developing your application in Microservices architecture because Dropbox is moving to that architecture?
* Did you buy Apple stock because Warren Buffet bought it?

**The diagnosis:** If you are guilty of any of the above or the likes, you **copied the visible at the cost of the principles**.

## The Tamil Movie Comedy: The Danger of Copy-Paste

**The setup:** Allow me to entertain you with a comedy scene from a Tamil movie that brings out this point even better.

There is a pair of comedians in Tamil movies, who are like Laurel and Hardy. They together have produced many hilarious scenes, some of which evoke laughter even today. The below scene appears in one such comical scene.

**The characters:** In this movie, Goundamani is head of a village, and Senthil is his assistant. Goundamani is smart, knows what to say in any situation, and the villagers respect him. Goundamani is haughty and never misses a chance to deride Senthil. Senthil envies him and wants to prove he is smart too. He accompanies Goundamani everywhere and observes what he says in every situation.

**The first situation:** In one such situation, an older woman passes away. Goundamani is invited, and Senthil tags along. "She wasn't just a mother to you," he comforts the family that lost their mother, "she was a mother to all of us." He goes on with his eulogy, but Senthil notes down this point.

**The mistake:** At the climactic scene, another lady, a wife this time, dies. Goundamani is sick and can't leave the bed. Senthil recollects the earlier scene and offers to go to the funeral.

**The result:** You guessed what he would have said, didn't you? "She wasn't just a wife to you," he cuts & pastes the words, "she was a wife to all of us."

**The lesson:** The latest trends, tools, and practices are visible. They are easy to copy. They are the seed for fun talks in the cocktail parties. But when the context changes, you are handicapped.

## Principles vs. Processes

**Why processes fail:** The latest trends, tools, and practices are visible. They are easy to copy. They are the seed for fun talks in the cocktail parties. But when the context changes, you are handicapped.

**Why principles endure:** Principles are the opposite. Nobody enjoys squeezing their brain, challenging it's cemented beliefs. Yet **principles determine whether you thrive or fade away**.

## David Ogilvy's Lesson: Principles Enable Any Tool

**The story:** David Ogilvy, the father of direct marketing, shared this anecdote in his _Confessions_.

A man walked into Ogilvy's London agency wanting to advertise the opening of his hotel. Since he had just $500, he was turned to the novice, David Ogilvy. Ogilvy bought $500 worth of postcards and sent invitations to everybody he found in the local telephone directory. The hotel opened with a full house.

**The insight:** As David Ogilvy proves, if you understand the principles well, you could use any tool to achieve the results. If you know the principles well, you would be further than those who use the tool without an understanding of the underlying tenets.

## The Endurance of Principles

**What churns faster:** What is on the surface, like tools and processes, churn faster.

**What lasts:** If you want to last longer in a field with respect, focus on fundamental principles governing it.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Focus on principles, not processes** - The visible (tools, processes, trends) is easy to copy but fails when context changes.

2. **Principles endure, processes churn** - Tools and processes change rapidly; fundamental principles remain constant.

3. **Understand principles to use any tool** - If you understand principles well, you can use any tool to achieve results (like Ogilvy's postcards).

4. **The cost of copying visible** - Copying the visible at the cost of principles leaves you handicapped when context changes.

5. **Principles determine success** - Principles determine whether you thrive or fade away.

6. **It's harder but worth it** - Nobody enjoys challenging cemented beliefs, but it's necessary for lasting success.

7. **Examples of the mistake:**
   - Focusing on fonts/colors instead of content
   - Rolling out tools without training on fundamentals
   - Copying style without understanding substance (Steve Jobs turtlenecks)
   - Tuning logo instead of finding product-market fit
   - Adopting architectures because others do (microservices)
   - Following investment decisions blindly (Buffett buying Apple)

8. **The test** - Are you copying visible patterns without understanding underlying principles? If so, you're at risk when context changes.

9. **Photography analogy** - Camera equipment is visible and easy to discuss, but lighting, composition, and creativity are the principles that actually matter.

10. **The Senthil mistake** - Copy-pasting words without understanding context leads to embarrassment and failure.
