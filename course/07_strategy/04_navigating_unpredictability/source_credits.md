- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive exploration of why experts consistently fail to predict the future (Goldman Sachs analysts, McKinsey consultants, chess grandmasters all get it wrong), yet why strategy is still essential. The article provides evidence from economic forecasting (T-Bill rates, oil receipts, solar installations consistently underestimated), drug sales predictions (almost two-thirds miss by 40%+), and even chess tournaments (Carlsen was favorite but Giri won). Paradox: Base rates don't help (Musk predicted 50% CAGR for Tesla, base rate showed <3% average with no companies >40%, yet Tesla achieved 55%). Solution: Have a strategy (even when wrong) and follow customer behavior. Case studies: Slack (Game Neverending → Flickr → Glitch → Slack, where Butterfield insisted on "organizational transformation" but customers wanted "just chat"), WhatsApp (status updates → push notifications → group chat → "SMS but free"), Code Collaborator (abuse of Code Historian for peer review became 97% of revenue). Ten strategies that defeat unpredictability: (1) Build a moat, (2) Have more than one way to succeed (optionality), (3) Leverage your assets, (4) Intentionally reactive (iterate fast, learn fast), (5) Hedged bets (insurance-like strategies), (6) Extreme novelty (new categories), (7) Form coalitions, (8) Expand scope of prediction (Futures Cone), (9) Stay simple, (10) Bet on what will not change (Bezos method). Key principles: Strategy is required even when wrong (gives direction, creates interesting things that attract early fans), customer behavior is always directionally right (customers are where you discover how to upgrade strategy), product "abuse" is a strong signal. The article emphasizes that deliberation assumes we know how to reason about the future, but even experts aren't good at that—making decisions and gaining experience is how to find the right answers.
