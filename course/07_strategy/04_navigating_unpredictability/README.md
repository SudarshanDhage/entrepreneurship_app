# Module: Navigating Unpredictability

"We dramatically, repeatedly fail to predict the future. Does that mean 'strategy' is senseless? No, it means you need these techniques to navigate a volatile world."

Experts consistently fail to predict the future—whether it's Goldman Sachs analysts forecasting economic metrics, McKinsey consultants predicting drug sales, or chess grandmasters predicting tournament winners. Yet strategy is still essential.

This module explores why prediction is nearly impossible, why strategy is still necessary, and the specific techniques that help you navigate a volatile, unpredictable world.
