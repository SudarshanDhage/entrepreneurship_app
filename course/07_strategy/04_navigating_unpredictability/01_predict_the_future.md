# Predict the Future

"We dramatically, repeatedly fail to predict the future. Does that mean 'strategy' is senseless? No, it means you need these techniques to navigate a volatile world."

## The Prediction Problem

### Experts Get It Wrong

Analysts at Goldman Sachs spend their whole life learning advanced mathematics, building sophisticated models of complex corners of the world, and are financially incentivized to predict the future accurately, because Goldman Sachs makes billions of dollars if they can be 10% more correct than the next firm.

So, how accurately did they predict economic metrics within their area of expertise? They got it very wrong, for 25 years, often not even directionally correct, in things like T-Bill rates and oil receipts and solar installations.

For example, predictions of the number of solar installations have consistently been 3x too low for two decades.

### Drug Sales Are Also Unpredictable

Researchers at McKinsey & Company studied the sales forecasts for new drugs made by analysts at brokerage firms. The data included more than 1,700 individual forecasts on 260 drugs over a recent ten-year span. The average error was large. Almost two-thirds of the estimates missed the peak revenue amount by 40 percent or more. Further, forecasts for follow-on drugs were no better than the first launches within a therapeutic class.

Once again, highly incentivized, highly trained analysts, within their area of expertise, within a well-understood, highly-regulated industry, mostly get it really wrong.

### Base Rates Don't Help Much

Using "base rates" as a reality check is one suggested method to increase prediction accuracy. For example, when Elon Musk suggested Tesla might achieve a 50 percent compound annual growth rate of sales for the next decade, analysts looked at the distribution of 10-year sales growth rates for more than 1,200 companies of a similar size. The average growth rate was less than three percent, with no companies achieving a compound annual growth rate in excess of 40 percent.

Musk's call was completely outrageous when using the base-rate method.

It is 2023 as of this writing, so we can now evaluate Musk's call: **Actual Tesla revenue CAGR since 2015 is 55%**—even more than Musk's 2015 claim.

So, the base-rate method is suspicious, and the analysts are suspicious. Is anything not suspicious?

### Chess Grandmasters Can't Predict Either

Chess Grandmasters spend far more than 10,000 hours reaching an elite, unbelievable level of skill. They instantly pattern-match board positions against thousands of games they've memorized. They understand the relative strength of the best players, because they've studied their games for years.

So when they guess who is going to win the 85th annual Tata Steel tournament—arguably the most prestigious tournament on the annual circuit—it is more than just "sports betting." It's betting by deeply educated experts.

How did their predictions go?

The "base rate" prediction is that Magnus Carlsen—the world #1 in all three major categories of chess, arguably the best player to have ever lived—should win, and indeed he was given the highest probability of winning before the tournament began, even up to round 4.

But Nordirbek Abdusattorov—an 18-year-old junior player rated more than 100 Elo points lower than Carlsen (an enormous gap)—was given such a small sliver of a chance at the start that it's hard to even read the number. He lead the tournament standings until the very last game. He also beat Carlsen in round 5.

And Giri was never given more than a 30% chance; usually 10% or less. He won the entire thing.

The same thing happened during the last FIFA World Cup. Argentina—the eventual winner—was never given much of a chance; even in the quarter-finals the bets were on France.

## The Strategy Paradox

When we build strategies, we're predicting what sorts of products are going to sell, often inside a fast-changing market, selling to customers with fickle desires in an ever-changing competitive landscape. Drugs that address a well-known disease with well-known rates of incidence and trends, with well-known competition, are easy in comparison. Easy, but already almost impossible even by the experts.

**So why do we think we can do it?**

## Case Study: Slack and WhatsApp

### Slack's Unexpected Journey

Stewart Butterfield always wanted to make a game. So, in 2002, he did: "Game Neverending," an in-browser multi-player online game "with no way to win, nor any definition of success."

It failed, but it had some interesting features. Alpha testers liked that they could share game objects by dragging them into chat windows. So, the engineers created an online application for real-time chat with image-sharing.

This chat application only worked in real-time—your pictures didn't stick around when you closed the app. And this was fatal because it turns out people were interested in the sharing part more than the real-time part. So in yet another upheaval they rewrote the Flash application as a regular website, and **Flickr was born**. By 2008 it had become the largest photo-sharing site in the world.

Yahoo bought Flickr for $25M in 2005; Butterfield left three years later. Now that he had money in his pocket, he was free to go back and do what he always wanted to do, which was to make a game. So, in 2009, he did: **Glitch**.

But once again it was a failure, and shut down. But once again there was a piece of the game that people really liked, and once again it was the chat system. Butterfield pivoted the company with a new mission, and a new name: **SLACK**, the Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.

Butterfield was certain that merely "building yet another chat system" was a bad strategy, whereas "transforming communications" was a good strategy:

> "We are unlikely to be able to sell 'a group chat system' very well: there are just not enough people shopping for group chat. That's why what we're selling is organizational transformation."

Once again, great theory, great mission, great strategy… and it didn't work. Slack was, and is, yet another chat system.

Fortunately for him, Butterfield was also wrong that "just chat" wouldn't sell very well. Slack was one of the fastest-growing companies in history.

### WhatsApp's Parallel Story

Initially WhatsApp was just a way to post a public status message, so friends could see what everyone is up to, hence "WhatsApp" (like "What's Up"). No one cared.

Then the iPhone launched push-notifications, so they added a feature to alert you when a friend's status changed. People started abusing this as a crude form of group-chat. So they added group-chat as a proper feature.

The correct strategy was simple: SMS costs money for most people in the world, so a winning product strategy is "SMS, but free." That strategy worked.

The rise of WhatsApp directly correlates with the fall of SMS messaging.

## The Solution

The Slack and WhatsApp stories of unpredictable success have at least two things in common:

1. **They had a strategy**—a philosophy of what would be entertaining or useful, a design sense of what would be delightful, brand new ideas for features and user interactions that people loved. They didn't just throw random things at the wall.

2. **They went where the customers took them**—if not a game, then sharing images; if not another game, then better chat; if not corporate omni-search, then chat with APIs, if not status updates, then free SMS.

### Two Key Principles

**A strategy is required, even when it's wrong.**

A strategy gives you a direction. A direction creates something interesting. Something interesting might be used by zealous early fans, even if it ends up uncovering the answer rather than being the answer.

If Game Neverending wasn't delightful enough to attract alpha testers, there would never have been a reboot into Flickr; if Glitch didn't have 150,000 users at its peak, there wouldn't be the idea for Slack; if Slack didn't have enormous ambitions, it would not have received VC funding.

A corollary: Making a decision and moving forward is often more effective than extended deliberation about the decision. Deliberation assumes we know how to reason about the future, but even experts aren't good at that. Making decisions and gaining experience is how to find the right answers, if the organization is introspective enough to also face the truth when it turns out the original strategy is incorrect.

**The customer (behavior) is always (directionally) right.**

There is a contradiction in these two points. Point (1) is to have a firm strategy, yet point (2) is to go wherever the customers are, even if that violates (1). If you just do "whatever customers want," how is that a strategy?

The answer is: Customers are where you discover how to upgrade your strategy. Since you know your initial strategy is wrong, following customers' lead is how you correct it.

When a customer loves one feature especially, or asks for adjacent features, those requests themselves are not your new strategy; the intent behind them might be. So "give me push notifications for my status updates" is a feature request, but the reason they want that is to circumvent SMS, and incorporating that idea is the strategy upgrade.

### Product "Abuse" Is a Strong Signal

Perhaps the most interesting signal is when the customer abuses your product to accomplish something else. The desire for that "something else" is so great, they're willing to use the wrong tool to get it done.

For example, our first product (Code Historian) let you visualize the history of your codebase, which seemed cool but few people paid for it. But people abused it to enable peer review. We were getting feature requests like: "Let me package up what's on my screen and send it to someone else," and "Let me write directly on a line of code and send it back."

A new product was born (Code Collaborator) which within a few years represented 97% of the revenue of the company. "Abuse" is a strong, positive signal for customer demand, and worthy of a change in strategy.

## Strategies That Defeat Unpredictability

While it might not be possible to predict the future, it is possible for a strategy to side-step unpredictability through these mechanisms:

### 1. Build a Moat

A "moat" is a long-term, durable competitive advantage. A structural advantage that others cannot disrupt, lasting for years, is resilient to the volatility of your competitive market.

### 2. Have More Than One Way to Succeed

If multiple things all have to go right for a plan to succeed, it probably won't succeed. That sort of plan tacitly assumes we can predict the future of many different components; surely a bad bet.

This is why startups are difficult in the first place: We have to have an insight and build a compelling product and be able to reach target customers and do that cost-effectively and at a price customers will accept and be better than the competition for some segment and not lose a key team member early on and not have global economic failure.

A resilient plan is built of "or" not "and." We could reach customers through social media or paid advertisement or influencer marketing or channel sales. A product that at least could be sold in all those ways is more likely to succeed than a product which can only be sold a single way.

**Optionality defeats unpredictability:**

- A product that is very low cost to create has many options for pricing, and therefore more likely to find effective pricing.
- A product in a large, growing market has many niches and personas and channels to potentially target, and therefore it's more likely you'll find some combination that works.
- Some indie developers build multiple small products, then pour their effort into whichever one happens to take off.

As Nassim Taleb wrote in *Antifragile*:

> "If you 'have optionality,' you don't have much need for what is commonly called intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills, and these complicated things that take place in our brain cells. For you don't have to be right that often. All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself (some acts of omission) and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur."

### 3. Leverage Your Assets

"Strike where you are strong and the enemy is weak" said Sun Tzu 2,500 years ago, echoing into strategy-design from the SWOT of the 1970s to modern agile frameworks.

This is obvious but often forgotten by entrepreneurs who believe they have found lucrative opportunities with amazing product ideas, but which fall outside of their sphere of competency, where the enemy is strong and they are weak. Any venture is likely to fail for many—unpredictable—reasons; the very least you can do, is leverage your capabilities, knowledge, network, (professional) friends, and accumulated assets.

When you pick the battle you are best-suited to win, you have a higher chance of winning regardless of the unpredictability of the world around you.

### 4. Intentionally Reactive

If you cannot predict the future, one option is to spend no time whatsoever trying to plan. Just react to what you see now, and use your judgement and a long-term strategy to solve the immediate opportunities while advancing a long-term agenda.

We know, we know… iterate fast, learn fast, get to the right answer fast. We know that, we say that, but then we take four months to deliver one feature, or take 18 months before we're "ready" to launch. Truly embracing and living the idea of constant delivery, constant feedback, constant learning loops, constant adjustment of hypothesis, quick decision-making, quick updating of prior decisions, no ego tied up with who was right or wrong about what, treating all doors as two-way doors, more than lip-service but encoded into the DNA of the organization, can overcome unpredictable barriers.

There was no real prediction to begin with, just a constant stream of hypotheses, continuously updated.

### 5. Hedged Bets

If you buy 30-year life insurance and live for 60 more years, you will make far more money than the insurance costs, so you come out ahead. If you buy 30-year life insurance and die in 2 years, your family will receive far more money than the insurance costs, so you come out ahead. Thus "insurance" is a way to always come out ahead, without predicting the future.

The catch: You've reduced your maximum upside. On balance, however, this "tax" is worth it, because you're trading slightly less maximum upside for predictable, net-positive outcomes.

**Strategies can also "buy insurance," i.e. come out ahead either way, albeit with a tax. Examples:**

- **Multiple vendors for same service.** Shift workloads based on price and performance.
- **Multiple brands** (whether created or acquired). Each finds a different niche, some will fail, some will take off.
- **Multiple simultaneous solutions.** To create iOS, Apple had the iPod team try to expand their OS to be more capable, while simultaneously having the Macintosh team try to reduce their OS to fit on a mobile device. One result was in-fighting, demonstrating that "cost" can be personal. But the result was that they selected the correct way forward for the iPhone.
- **Redundant systems.** City power, and a generator. Multiple servers in different geographic regions. Teams, not solo engineers. Redundancy is a cost, but the result is more predictable operation.
- **Disrupt thyself.** Create new products that disrupt your existing products. The quintessential example is Amazon launching the Kindle; Bezos instructed the newly-anointed Kindle leader—who was the leader over their book-selling business—that "Effective tomorrow, your job is to kill your old business with a Kindle." Whether the future is in physical books, electronic books, or both, Amazon prospers.

### 6. Extreme Novelty

Zappos, Airbnb, Uber, SpaceX, Tesla, Bitcoin, OpenAI, all took enormous risk by creating a new category that everyone else thought was impossible, even after they heard the plan. On one hand, this is the definition of unpredictability. On the other hand, they avoided the unpredictability that comes from existing competition in existing markets.

It doesn't matter what's happening at Amazon if you can return shoes for free even after 364 days; it doesn't matter how the hotel industry is shifting when you're selling a different experience; it doesn't matter what Ford and Toyota are doing with electric vehicles if you're changing the fundamental technology without the constraints of existing supply lines, dealer distribution rules, and ties to the oil and gas industry.

If everything is unpredictable anyway, why not earn strategic advantage: No direct competition, exciting place for top-talent to join, immense upside.

### 7. Form Coalitions

The more massive the object, the more it resists being moved by external forces.

Price-collusion removes the uncertainty of market pricing (though this is unethical and illegal in many countries; don't do it). Peace treaties prevent some wars. Open source projects attract more talent and advocates than any one organization could afford. Industry standards reduce the risk that core technology or protocols change, allowing members to build systems on top of those standard for decades, not having to "hedge." Good things happen when we all agree to use HTTP, HTML, and SSL.

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." —African proverb

### 8. Expand the Scope of Prediction

Predicting exactly what will happen is folly, but mapping possible futures can be illuminating:

The "Futures Cone" framework helps you recognize that perhaps improbable futures aren't quite as improbable, helps you think of solutions that mitigate plausible challenges, and help you recognize if an "improbable" thing is in fact happening.

Of course you're still ignorant not only of probabilities, but of eventualities that you never predicted. While this doesn't mean you suddenly can predict the future, it might mean you're paying more attention to what's actually happening, allowing you to react faster, and thus to manage the unpredictability better.

### 9. Stay Simple

The more tasks have to be broken-down, the more dependency arrows are drawn, the more intricate the analysis, the less believable the project estimate is. Complexity breeds unpredictability.

The inverse is that simplicity is predictable. While not strictly true, is it true that simple things can be more predictable. A simple product, with a simple value proposition, in a simple market, has fewer dependencies that require prediction, and thus are more likely to succeed.

### 10. Bet on What Will Not Change

Made famous by Jeff Bezos, it is difficult to predict how the future will change, but it can be easy to predict the ways the future will not change. In Amazon's case, he cites "low prices" and "fast delivery" as two of those things; in ten years, people will still want that. Therefore, Amazon can (and does) invest billions of dollars to achieve those results.

In the case of WhatsApp, consumers want to chat and don't want to pay; that was true ten years ago, it's still true today, and it's a good bet that it will be true ten years from now.

## The Lessons

Have a strategy, even though the world is unpredictable.

Decide quickly → get customer reactions quickly → learn quickly → make new decisions quickly.

Upgrade the strategy by following customer behavior.

Product "abuse" is a strong signal for updating the strategy.

The strategy must include building a moat or two.

The strategy must create optionality in how to succeed (or avoid failure) so that single failures aren't fatal.

The strategy must leverage your existing strengths, building a product for a market for which you are already well-suited.

Either keep it simple, form coalitions, or do something completely novel.

Bet on things that won't change, rather than predicting how things will change.

Do your homework, but don't stall in analysis paralysis. Map future possibilities, to mitigate possible things and to better notice when your assumptions turn out to be incorrect.

**That's how you win in an unpredictable world.**
