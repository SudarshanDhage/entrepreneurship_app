# Know Your Industry Landscape

Many founders don't understand the broader context that influences their ability to succeed. This is especially true in complex industries like cybersecurity, but applies everywhere.

**The market:** Its composition, forces that impact its direction, players that operate in it, and how all of this fits together. This includes:
- The worlds of insurance and government regulation
- Venture capital and three-letter agencies
- The legal landscape and channel partner ecosystem

Each component has a unique role. Understanding how they all interact, where they're at odds, and where they amplify each other's impact is key to successfully navigating the landscape and making sound business decisions.

**The types of buyers:** Their buying criteria and their buying journey.

Depending on geography, cultural context, industry, size of the organization you're targeting, and other characteristics, the company will need different things to succeed. Over and over, Ross Haleliuk sees companies saying things like "We are selling to enterprises," which means little: a bank in New York buys differently than a large tech company in Austin. The people who can influence the process in the Bay Area scaleup are different than those who can expedite or stall adoption at a pharmaceutical giant in Chicago.

Not understanding the context and the buying journey can lead to a lot of waste, and ultimately—a failed startup.

**The competition:** Its strengths, weaknesses, and the wedge it's trying to use.

When asked about competition, most founders start talking about their products, highlighting how their solution is superior, scalable, user-friendly, and feature-rich. Unfortunately, the product is not everything. Most of the time, companies that appear to do the same thing are built on different assumptions, target different market segments, and acquire customers in different ways.

Understanding the competitive landscape deeply is critical—not simply to build a better product, but to craft and execute a business strategy that has a higher chance of winning.

**How to build this understanding:** Spend time working in these organizations. If learning from the inside isn't an option, build a network of practitioners and decision-makers. Visualize the connections, relationships, and directions in which different players affect one another, the industry as a whole, and the strategy you're pursuing.

The same is true for competitive intelligence. It's not enough to get access to the competitor's product. You must understand how they're going about positioning and customer acquisition, what their runway is, what investor expectations are, and possibly even their exit strategy.
