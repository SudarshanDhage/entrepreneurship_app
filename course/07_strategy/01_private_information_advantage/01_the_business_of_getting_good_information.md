# The Business of Getting Good Information

"[The] business of seed investing, and frankly, early-stage entrepreneurship, is so much about getting good information. And almost all of that information, unfortunately, is not published."

That's the reality. And it's actually great news for startups.

**Why?** Because if information about your business is hard to get, that creates the mispriced opportunity you're seeking. Uncertainty in the early stages isn't your enemy. It's your friend.

Here's how it works: As you push forward—reducing technology risk, finding product/market fit, discovering methods to scale—uncertainty gets retired. And value gets created.

**The job of a great VC?** Provide entrepreneurs with entry into networks that let them quickly and cost-effectively find this private information.

The same principle applies to VCs themselves. Great venture capitalists are always trying to find good sources of information—particularly information that isn't published.

This is why networks matter. This is why experience matters. This is why domain expertise matters. Not just for you, but for your investors.

When information is public, everyone can act on it. Markets are efficient. Opportunities disappear.

But when information is private—when it's hard to get—that's where your advantage lives. That's where mispriced opportunities exist.

So don't worry if your market seems unclear. Don't worry if information is scarce. That's not a bug. That's a feature.
