- **Key Insight:** Framework describing how companies can pursue competitive advantage across chosen market scope. Three generic strategies: cost leadership, product differentiation, and focus (with two variants - cost focus and differentiation focus - making four distinct approaches). Core insight: Company chooses one of two types of competitive advantage - lower costs than competition OR differentiation along dimensions valued by customers to command higher price. Company also chooses one of two types of scope - focus (selected segments) OR industry-wide (many segments). Generic strategy reflects choices regarding both type of competitive advantage and scope. Porter's original argument: Must choose only one strategy or risk "stuck in the middle" scenario. Practicing more than one strategy loses focus, clear direction can't be established. Differentiation incurs costs contradicting low cost strategy. Standardized products won't carry differentiation. Cost leadership and differentiation mutually exclusive - two focal objectives clash. Empirical basis: "Hole in the middle" problem - firms with high market share (cost leaders) and low market share (niche players) profitable, firms with moderate market share (stuck in middle) least profitable. Exception: Combining market segmentation with product differentiation effective. Combinations like cost leadership with differentiation hard (but not impossible) due to conflict between cost minimization and value-added differentiation costs. Cost Leadership Strategy: Target customers in most/all segments based on lowest price. Win market share by appealing to cost-conscious/price-sensitive customers. Lowest prices or lowest price-to-value ratio. Must operate at lower cost than rivals. Three ways: (1) High asset utilization - service industries turn tables/flights fast, manufacturing high volume output. Fixed costs spread over more units = lower unit cost. Economies of scale/experience curve effects. High output requires/creates high market share, entry barrier. (2) Low direct/indirect operating costs - high volumes standardized products, basic no-frills, limit customization/personalization. Production costs low via fewer components, standard components, limit models. Overheads low via low wages, low rent areas, cost-conscious culture. Continuous cost reduction search - outsourcing, controlling production, increasing utilization, minimizing distribution/R&D/advertising. Extensive distribution. Promotional strategy makes virtue of low cost features. (3) Control over value chain - all functional groups (finance, supply/procurement, marketing, inventory, IT) ensure low costs. Supply chain: bulk buying/quantity discounts, squeeze suppliers, competitive bidding, low inventories (JIT, VMI). Example: Wal-Mart squeezing suppliers. Preferential raw materials access, backward integration. Viable for large firms with economies of scale/large volumes/big market share. Small businesses can be "cost focused" not "cost leaders" if have low cost advantages. Example: Local restaurant low rent location, limited menu, rapid turnover, minimum wage staff. Innovation may enable startup/small company offer cheaper product where incumbents too expensive. Example: Low-cost budget airlines - fewer planes but market share growth via cheap no-frills services. Started with cost focused, grew to cost leadership. Disadvantages: Lower customer loyalty (price-sensitive switch when substitute available), reputation for low quality (hard to rebrand/shift to differentiation). Differentiation Strategy: Target customers in most/all segments based on attributes other than price (quality/service) to command higher price. Differentiate favorably relative to competition. Minimize costs in areas that don't differentiate, remain cost competitive. Appropriate when: target segment not price-sensitive, competitive/saturated market, customers have specific under-served needs, firm has unique resources/capabilities difficult to copy. Unique resources: patents/IP, unique technical expertise (Apple design, Pixar animation), talented personnel (sports stars, star traders), innovative processes. Success when: premium price, increased revenue per unit, brand loyalty. Works when added price outweighs added expense, ineffective when uniqueness easily replicated. Brand management creates perceived uniqueness even when physical product same (Chiquita bananas, Starbucks coffee, Nike sneakers, fashion brands). Examples: Hero, Asian Paints, HUL, Nike, BMW, Perstorp BioProducts, Apple, Mercedes-Benz. Not suitable for small companies. Appropriate for big companies applying in one/several functional groups. Example: GE uses finance division to differentiate. May do in isolation or conjunction with focus strategies (requires more investment). Good advantage using differentiation with focus cost/differentiation strategies. Example: Coca-Cola and Royal Crown. Variants: Shareholder value model - timing of specialized knowledge creates differentiation advantage while unique. Customers buy for access to unique knowledge. Advantage static (one-time purchase). Unlimited resources model - greater resources manage risk/sustain profits more easily. Short-term advantage only. Without continual innovation capacity, won't sustain competitive position. Note: Henry Mintzberg argues cost leadership is form of differentiation using lower price. Focus Strategies: Focusing on one or few segments. May offer lower cost (cost focus) OR differentiate (differentiation focus) in that scope. Not separate strategy for big companies due to small market conditions. Big companies applying differentiation may also use focus strategies. Definitely appropriate for small companies, especially wanting to avoid competition with big ones. Narrow focus on few target markets (segmentation/niche strategy). Distinct groups with specialized needs. Choice of low prices or differentiated products/services depends on segment needs and firm resources/capabilities. Focus marketing on one-two narrow segments, tailor marketing mix. Gain competitive advantage through product innovation/brand marketing rather than efficiency. Target segments less vulnerable to substitutes or where competition weakest for above-average ROI. Example: Southwest Airlines - short-haul point-to-point vs hub-and-spoke of United/American. Subsequent Developments: Treacy and Wiersema (1993) modified Porter's three strategies in "The Discipline of Market Leaders" to three "value disciplines": operational excellence, product leadership, customer intimacy. Criticisms/Hybrid Strategy Debate: Several commentators questioned generic strategies - lack specificity, flexibility, limiting, empirical challenges. Miller questions "caught in the middle" - viable middle ground exists. Many companies enter as niche player and expand. Baden-Fuller and Stopford: most successful companies resolve "dilemma of opposites." Reeves and Routledge (2013): entrepreneurial spirit key factor in success, differentiation/cost leadership least important. Contemporary research shows evidence of successful "hybrid strategy." Davis (1984): firms employing hybrid (low cost + differentiation) outperform ones adopting one generic strategy. Hill (1988): challenged mutual exclusivity, argued successful combination results in sustainable competitive advantage. Wright (1990): multiple strategies required to respond effectively to environment. Mid-late 1980s environments stable - no flexibility requirement. Present market contexts rapidly changing/highly unpredictable - require flexibility for contingencies. After 11 years Porter revised thinking and accepted hybrid business strategy could exist. Why hybrid necessary: Highly volatile/turbulent markets don't permit rigid strategies. Long-term establishment depends on agility/quick responsiveness. Market/environmental turbulence makes drastic implications on firm establishment. If strategy can't cope with contingencies, long-term survival unrealistic. Pragmatic approach: Diverging strategy into different avenues to exploit opportunities/avoid threats. Consistent superior performance possible with hybrid strategy - stronger foundations. Depending on market/competitive conditions, hybrid should be adjusted regarding extent each generic strategy (cost leadership or differentiation) given priority. Key Takeaways: Three fundamental strategic options - cost leadership, differentiation, focus. Choice matters - Porter originally argued must choose one or risk "stuck in middle." Context matters - appropriateness depends on firm size, market conditions, resources. Debate continues - framework influential but empirical evidence/practical experience suggest hybrid strategies successful, especially volatile markets. Flexibility key - rapidly changing markets may require combining strategies or adjusting emphasis. Small vs large - focus appropriate for small companies, cost leadership requires scale.
