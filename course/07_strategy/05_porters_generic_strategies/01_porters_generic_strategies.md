# Porter's Generic Strategies

Michael Porter's framework for how a company can pursue competitive advantage across its chosen market scope. The three generic strategies are cost leadership, product differentiation, and focus.

## The Concept

Michael Porter's generic strategies describe how a company can pursue competitive advantage across its chosen market scope. There are three generic strategies: **cost leadership, product differentiation, and focus**. The focus strategy comprises two variants—cost focus and differentiation focus—allowing the overall framework to be interpreted as four distinct strategic approaches.

**Core insight:** A company chooses to pursue one of two types of competitive advantage:
- **Lower costs** than its competition, OR
- **Differentiation** along dimensions valued by customers to command a higher price

A company also chooses one of two types of scope:
- **Focus** (offering its products to selected segments of the market), OR
- **Industry-wide** (offering its product across many market segments)

The generic strategy reflects the choices made regarding both the type of competitive advantage and the scope.

**Original formulation:** Porter wrote in 1980 that strategy targets either cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. These are known as his three generic strategies, which can be applied to any size or form of business. Porter claimed that a company must only choose one of the three or risk that the business would waste precious resources.

**The fundamental choice:** Achieving competitive advantage requires a firm to make a choice about the type of competitive advantage it seeks to attain and the scope within which it will attain it. The two basic types of competitive advantage (differentiation and lower cost) combined with the scope of activities lead to three generic strategies for achieving above average performance in an industry.

## The Three Generic Strategies

### 1. Cost Leadership Strategy

**Definition:** If a firm is targeting customers in most or all segments of an industry based on offering the lowest price, it is following a cost leadership strategy.

**How it works:** Cost leadership strategies involve the firm winning market share by appealing to cost-conscious or price-sensitive customers. This is achieved by having the lowest prices in the target market segment, or at least the lowest price to value ratio (price compared to what customers receive). To succeed at offering the lowest price while still achieving profitability and a high return on investment, the firm must be able to operate at a lower cost than its rivals.

**Three main ways to achieve cost leadership:**

**1. Achieving a high asset utilization:**
- In service industries: turning tables around very quickly, turning around flights very fast
- In manufacturing: production of high volumes of output
- Fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units, resulting in lower unit cost
- Taking advantage of economies of scale and experience curve effects
- Higher levels of output require and result in high market share, and create an entry barrier to potential competitors

**2. Achieving low direct and indirect operating costs:**
- Offering high volumes of standardized products
- Offering basic no-frills products
- Limiting customization and personalization of service
- Production costs kept low by using fewer components, standard components, limiting number of models
- Overheads kept low by paying low wages, locating premises in low rent areas, establishing cost-conscious culture
- Continuous search for cost reductions in all aspects of the business
- Includes outsourcing, controlling production costs, increasing asset capacity utilization, minimizing distribution/R&D/advertising costs
- Associated distribution strategy: obtain most extensive distribution possible
- Promotional strategy: often involves trying to make a virtue out of low cost product features

**3. Control over the value chain:**
- Encompassing all functional groups (finance, supply/procurement, marketing, inventory, information technology, etc.) to ensure low costs
- In supply chain context: bulk buying for quantity discounts, squeezing suppliers on price, competitive bidding, keeping inventories low (Just-in-Time, Vendor-Managed Inventory)
- Examples: Wal-Mart famous for squeezing suppliers, preferential access to raw materials, backward integration

**When it's viable:** Cost leadership strategies are only viable for large firms with the opportunity to enjoy economies of scale and large production volumes and big market share. Small businesses can be "cost focused" not "cost leaders" if they enjoy any advantages conducive to low costs.

**Examples:** Low-cost budget airlines who achieved market share growth by offering cheap, no-frills services at prices much cheaper than larger incumbents. At the beginning low-cost budget airlines chose "cost focused" strategies but later when the market grew, big airlines started to offer the same low-cost attributes, and so cost focus became cost leadership.

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower customer loyalty, as price-sensitive customers will switch once a lower-priced substitute is available
- A reputation as a cost leader may result in a reputation for low quality, which may make it difficult to rebrand or shift to a differentiation strategy in future

### 2. Differentiation Strategy

**Definition:** If a firm targets customers in most or all segments based on attributes other than price (e.g., via higher product quality or service) to command a higher price, it is pursuing a differentiation strategy. It is attempting to differentiate itself along these dimensions favorably relative to its competition.

**How it works:** Businesses operating this strategy differentiate their products/services in some way in order to compete successfully. They seek to minimize costs in areas that do not differentiate them, to remain cost competitive.

**When it's appropriate:**
- Where the target customer segment is not price-sensitive
- The market is competitive or saturated
- Customers have very specific needs which are possibly under-served
- The firm has unique resources and capabilities which enable it to satisfy these needs in ways that are difficult to copy

**Unique resources and capabilities that enable differentiation:**
- Patents or other intellectual property (IP)
- Unique technical expertise (e.g. Apple's design skills or Pixar's animation prowess)
- Talented personnel (e.g. a sports team's star players or a brokerage firm's star traders)
- Innovative processes

**Success indicators:** Successful differentiation is displayed when a company accomplishes either:
- A premium price for the product or service
- Increased revenue per unit
- Consumer loyalty to purchase the company's product or service (brand loyalty)

**When it works:** Differentiation drives profitability when the added price of the product outweighs the added expense to acquire the product or service, but is ineffective when its uniqueness is easily replicated by its competitors.

**Brand management:** Successful brand management results in perceived uniqueness even when the physical product is the same as competitors. This way, Chiquita was able to brand bananas, Starbucks could brand coffee, and Nike could brand sneakers. Fashion brands rely heavily on this form of image differentiation.

**Examples:** Hero, Asian Paints, HUL, Nike athletic shoes (image and brand mark), BMW Group Automobiles, Perstorp BioProducts, Apple Computer (product's design), and Mercedes-Benz automobiles.

**When it's suitable:** Differentiation strategy is not suitable for small companies. It is more appropriate for big companies to apply differentiation in any one or several of the functional groups (finance, purchase, marketing, inventory, etc.). For example, GE uses its finance division to differentiate itself. A company may do so in isolation of other strategies or in conjunction with focus strategies (requires more initial investment).

**Note:** Henry Mintzberg, another business writer, argues that cost leadership is really a form of differentiation, using a lower price as a form of differentiation.

**Variants on the differentiation strategy:**

**The shareholder value model:** Holds that the timing of the use of specialized knowledge can create a differentiation advantage as long as the knowledge remains unique. This model suggests that customers buy products or services from an organization to have access to its unique knowledge. The advantage is static, rather than dynamic, because the purchase is a one-time event.

**The unlimited resources model:** Utilizes competitors by practicing a differentiation strategy. An organization with greater resources can manage risk and sustain profits more easily than one with fewer resources. This provides a short-term advantage only. If a firm lacks the capacity for continual innovation, it will not sustain its competitive position over time.

### 3. Focus Strategies

**Definition:** If a firm is focusing on one or a few segments, it is following a focus strategy. A firm may be attempting to offer a lower cost in that scope (cost focus) or differentiate itself in that scope (differentiation focus).

**The focus dimension:** This dimension is not a separate strategy for big companies due to small market conditions. Big companies which choose applying differentiation strategies may also choose to apply in conjunction with focus strategies (either cost or differentiation). On the other hand, this is definitely an appropriate strategy for small companies especially for those wanting to avoid competition with big ones.

**How it works:** In adopting a narrow focus, the company ideally focuses on a few target markets (also called a segmentation strategy or niche strategy). These should be distinct groups with specialized needs. The choice of offering low prices or differentiated products/services should depend on the needs of the selected segment and the resources and capabilities of the firm.

**The approach:** By focusing marketing efforts on one or two narrow market segments and tailoring the marketing mix to these specialized markets, you can better meet the needs of that target market. The firm typically looks to gain a competitive advantage through product innovation and/or brand marketing rather than efficiency.

**Target selection:** A focused strategy should target market segments that are less vulnerable to substitutes or where a competition is weakest to earn above-average return on investment.

**Example:** Southwest Airlines, which provides short-haul point-to-point flights in contrast to the hub-and-spoke model of mainstream carriers, United Airlines and American Airlines.

## Porter's Original Argument: "Stuck in the Middle"

**Porter's claim:** Porter stressed the idea that only one strategy should be adopted by a firm and failure to do so will result in the "stuck in the middle" scenario. He discussed the idea that practicing more than one strategy will lose the entire focus of the organization: hence clear direction of the future trajectory could not be established.

**The rationale:**
- Differentiation will incur costs to the firm which clearly contradicts with the basis of low cost strategy
- Relatively standardized products with features acceptable to many customers will not carry any differentiation
- Cost leadership and differentiation strategy will be mutually exclusive
- Two focal objectives of low cost leadership and differentiation clash with each other resulting in no proper direction for a firm

**The "hole in the middle" problem:** Empirical research on the profit impact of marketing strategy indicated that firms with a high market share were often quite profitable, but so were many firms with low market share. The least profitable firms were those with moderate market share. Porter's explanation is that firms with high market share were successful because they pursued a cost leadership strategy and firms with low market share were successful because they used market segmentation to focus on a small but profitable market niche. Firms in the middle were less profitable because they did not have a strategy.

**The exception:** Porter suggested that combining multiple strategies is successful in only one case. Combining a market segmentation strategy with a product differentiation strategy was seen as an effective way of matching a firm's product strategy (supply side) to the characteristics of target market segments (demand side). But combinations like cost leadership with product differentiation were seen as hard (but not impossible) to implement, due to the potential for conflict between cost minimization and the additional cost of value-added differentiation.

## Subsequent Developments and Criticisms

### The "Hybrid Strategy" Debate

**Empirical evidence:** Since Porter's original work, empirical research has indicated companies pursuing both differentiation and low-cost strategies may be more successful than companies pursuing only one strategy.

**The "best cost" variant:** Some commentators have made a distinction between cost leadership (low cost strategies) and best cost strategies. They claim that a low cost strategy is rarely able to provide a sustainable competitive advantage. In most cases firms end up in price wars. Instead, they claim a best cost strategy is preferred. This involves providing the best value for a relatively low price.

**Miller's critique:** Miller questions the notion of being "caught in the middle." He claims that there is a viable middle ground between strategies. Many companies, for example, have entered a market as a niche player and gradually expanded. According to Baden-Fuller and Stopford (1992), the most successful companies are the ones that can resolve what they call "the dilemma of opposites."

**Reeves and Routledge's study:** Their 2013 study of entrepreneurial spirit demonstrated this is a key factor in organization success. Differentiation and cost leadership were the least important factors.

**Evidence for hybrid strategies:** Contemporary research has shown evidence of successful firms practicing a "hybrid strategy":
- Research writings of Davis (1984) state that firms employing the hybrid business strategy (low cost and differentiation strategy) outperform the ones adopting one generic strategy
- Hill (1988) challenged Porter's concept regarding mutual exclusivity of low cost and differentiation strategy and further argued that successful combination of those two strategies will result in sustainable competitive advantage
- Wright and others (1990) argued multiple business strategies are required to respond effectively to any environment condition

**Porter's revision:** After eleven years Porter revised his thinking and accepted the fact that hybrid business strategy could exist.

**Why hybrid strategies may be necessary:** The highly volatile and turbulent market conditions will not permit survival of rigid business strategies since long-term establishment will depend on the agility and the quick responsiveness towards market and environmental conditions. Market and environmental turbulence will make drastic implications on the root establishment of a firm. If a firm's business strategy could not cope with the environmental and market contingencies, long-term survival becomes unrealistic.

**The pragmatic approach:** Diverging the strategy into different avenues with the view to exploit opportunities and avoid threats created by market conditions will be a pragmatic approach for a firm. Consistent and superior performance over competition could be reached with stronger foundations in the event "hybrid strategy" is adopted. Depending on the market and competitive conditions, hybrid strategy should be adjusted regarding the extent which each generic strategy (cost leadership or differentiation) should be given priority in practice.

### The Value Disciplines Modification

**Treacy and Wiersema (1993):** Modified Porter's three strategies in their book _The Discipline of Market Leaders_ to describe three basic "value disciplines" which can create customer value and provide a competitive advantage:
- **Operational excellence**
- **Product leadership**
- **Customer intimacy**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Porter's framework provides three fundamental strategic options:** cost leadership, differentiation, and focus.

2. **The choice matters:** Porter originally argued that a firm must choose one strategy or risk being "stuck in the middle."

3. **Context matters:** The appropriateness of each strategy depends on firm size, market conditions, and available resources.

4. **The debate continues:** While Porter's framework remains influential, empirical evidence and practical experience suggest hybrid strategies can be successful, especially in volatile markets.

5. **Flexibility may be key:** In rapidly changing, highly unpredictable markets, flexibility to combine strategies or adjust emphasis between them may be necessary for survival.

6. **Small vs. large firms:** Focus strategies are particularly appropriate for small companies wanting to avoid competition with big ones, while cost leadership typically requires scale.
