# Customer-Funded Growth

**The best source of capital is often a customer.** Selling has two benefits. First, you make the cash register ring immediately. Second, you quickly learn what resonates with customers and can use those insights to refine your offering.

**The savviest entrepreneurs design their business model so that they collect payment before they deliver their product, turning customers into a source of growth capital.**

**RXBar:** When one of the entrepreneurs behind RXBar shared his ambitious business plan with his father, the paterfamilias told his founder son to stop theorizing and start pounding the pavement, "You need to shut up and sell 1,000 bars." That advice, plus $10K in savings, proved to be worth $600M as Kellogg's ended up gobbling up the startup.

**Scentsy:** DNVBs are hip, but they are over-reliant on twee launch videos and Facebook ads to drive revenue. Scentsy sold candles at swap meets when they couldn't afford to buy ads. It wasn't glamorous, but it did give the founders a solid grounding on the messages that resonated with buyers—Now they have more than $545 million dollars a year in revenue.

**LootCrate:** LootCrate had over 600,000 customers buying their pop culture sample packages and $100M in revenue before they raised institutional capital. Part of the reason they were so efficient is that the company started charging customers from its first weekend in existence.

**Klaviyo:** The co-founders of Klaviyo agreed to postpone their first hire until they had a $1MM ARR. Thanks to keen product design and a tireless sales effort, the emerging email marketing platform quickly blew past that number but held off on raising capital for three years.

**Spanx:** Shark Tank judge Sara Blakely is the most famous founder on this list, having turned a $5,000 investment into an Oprah-approved garment that generates $400M in revenue annually. Her fashion sense earned her a following, but her keen appreciation of the principles of capital efficiency earned Blakely a billionaire status.

**Tuft and Needle:** Despite facing a competitor that raised 3,994,900% more capital, this mattress upstart has been able to grow to over $100M in sales using profits and just $6,000 in seed capital.

**Grammarly:** Spell checkers have been bundled with Word and Google Docs for over a decade, but Grammarly made enough improvements that they could charge over 800 universities and hundreds of thousands of writers a monthly fee for the freedom from grammatical faux pas. After nearly ten years of spotting typos, the company took in a $110M Series A.

**Funding doesn't always come millions of dollars at a time.** Founders can scrape together money from grants, incubators, and angels, or even pre-sales.

**CoolMiniOrNot:** CoolMiniOrNot started out as a website where geeks could show off their ability to paint Dungeons & Dragons figurines. Eventually, the site's founders decided to design and distribute games of their own; leveraging Kickstarter as a channel. They have run 21 Kickstarter campaigns which have raised $20,644,352 million dollars of non-dilutive funding. Game on.

**The Wirecutter:** Who says blogging doesn't pay? Founded by a former Gizmodo editor, the Wirecutter promised more thorough and fair-minded reviews, paired that with Amazon affiliate feed, and the self-funded startup was ultimately rewarded with a $30M exit.

**Be Miserly with Marketing**

Startup marketers might not want to waste time with unmeasurable brand marketing. Efficient entrepreneurs need campaigns to be additive, immediately.

**ButcherBox:** In a world where boxed meal kit companies are struggling on the public market, ButcherBox, the leading ecommerce provider of grass-fed beef, has thrived, earning as much as a million dollars a week by skipping expensive ad channels and developing ongoing, capital efficient relationships with influencers.

**Cards Against Humanity:** With just $15,700 in funding from Kickstarter, the Cards Against Humanity Team built a business that grossed over $12 million dollars in its first year. They've also sustained their brand with a series of canny marketing stunts, selling cow poop, cutting up a Picasso, digging a big hole representing the ennui of a post-Trump America, then selling Trump "bug out" bags, and simply asking for money. These promotions aren't cheap to run, but they make enough money to defray costs while earning a disproportionate amount of free media.

**GoFundMe:** Viral marketing is dismissed, rightfully, when it is tacked on to a business model, but it can be a powerful driver when properly integrated into a product. Paired with hyper-efficient Conversion Rate Optimization, it can be unbeatable. The founders of GoFundMe were able to use these twin forces to bootstrap a business to the point where it was valued at ~$600M.

**Efficiency > Capital**

Startups are often measured by how much money they've raised, but it's more important to consider how they spend. The best entrepreneurs orient their businesses around a technology or business model that is intrinsically more effective at multiplying capital.

**PaintNite:** The idea of combining Monet and Merlot isn't new, but the founders of PaintNite wanted to make the model more cost-effective. While their competitors relied on a slow, expensive franchise sales model, PaintNite paired art teachers with existing bars that wanted to sell wine on weekdays and created a business that did $30 million in revenue the year before it raised venture capital.

**Tough Mudder:** Track & field entrepreneur Will Dean turned $7,000 in savings into a company with over $100 million dollars in annual revenue. The secret was pre-selling registrations to races and then using those funds as working capital to construct the electrified obstacle courses that have made Tough Mudder a global phenomenon.
