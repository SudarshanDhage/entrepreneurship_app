# Build a Community

**Technology is important and business models matter, but assembling a group of passionate users can create a moat that is more powerful than either.**

**37 Signals/Basecamp:** The project management toolmaker doesn't disclose revenue but founder Jason Fried has said the company generates "tens of millions of annual profits." They were also one of the earliest voices championing capital efficiency and their "Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Proud" series is a must-read for anyone looking for tips on how to spend every dollar wisely.

**Mojang:** The masons behind Minecraft never raised any venture capital, employed just 50 people, and earned nearly a billion dollars in profit before selling to Microsoft. The Swedish studio never got sucked into fads like Zynga-inspired social spamming and predatory microtransactions. Minecraft grew by charging users a flat fee, resulting in a $2.5 billion dollar acquisition.

**Behance:** Scott Belsky bootstrapped creative community Behance for five years before raising $6.5 million from Union Square Ventures and ultimately being acquired for $150 million dollars.

**Thrillist:** Founded in 2004, newsletter/trendsetter Thrillist was built email by email until the company raised $54 million dollars in 2015.

**Craigslist:** Craigslist parlayed an early launch in the first dot-com boom into a durable long-term advantage. Despite having only 40 employees and not substantially updating the site for decades, Craigslist is the #17 most visited site in the US and is reported to generate hundreds of millions in profits.

**Plenty of Fish:** The dating site was founded in 2003 and didn't change functionality or aesthetics much over the following decade. As with Craigslist, Plenty of Fish's biggest asset was its reputation as a well-stocked pond. Ultimately, the company ended up selling for $575 million dollars.

**The lesson:** Build something people love. Create a place they want to be. The community becomes your competitive advantage.
