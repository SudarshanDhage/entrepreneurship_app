# The Bootstrap Mindset

**There's a widespread belief among founders that venture capital is a precursor to success.**

It's true that VC is a common denominator of the most successful tech startups. But it isn't a prerequisite, especially at the early stages.

**Entrepreneurs can prove out quite a bit with little to no capital.** Capital doesn't make funded founders any more insightful than their bootstrapped brethren.

**If someone can't creatively turn $1 into $10, why would you expect them to be able to turn $1M into $10M?**

Many of these companies have subsequently earned billion-dollar valuations, some even have billions of dollars in revenue, but none started with anything greater than what would be considered a seed round. Most had far less.

**A large percentage of these startups raised money from VCs, but only after they had established the fact that their success would come with or without a wire transfer from an investor.** Even now, many of them aren't widely known—they are the invisible unicorns of the tech industry.

**So before scrambling to schedule meetings with investors, remember:**
- Taking venture capital should be a choice, not a compulsion
- You don't need permission from funders to found and scale a startup
- Startups used to figure stuff out and then ask for money
- Today, they ask for money to figure things out—and outside of drug discovery or aeronautical hardware, this is usually the wrong decision

**Three principles:**
1. **It's possible to get a tech-enabled business off the ground with no capital.**
2. **It's feasible to scale a tech business rapidly with very little capital.**
3. **It's often in the founder's best interest to limit the amount of capital they take.**

Making progress without resources is the best way to pique a VC's interest.

**Don't design your business around VC.**
