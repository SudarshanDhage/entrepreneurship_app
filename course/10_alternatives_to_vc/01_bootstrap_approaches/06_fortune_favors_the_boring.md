# Fortune Favors the "Boring"

**Boring isn't a value judgment.** Many of the most impressive, successful companies that managed to grow without capital thrived by solving acute, if somewhat dull, problems and getting paid handsomely from the start.

**SurveyMonkey** was founded in the dot-com bubble of the 90s, and though it wasn't as disruptive as peers like Kosmo, it was more durable. It survived the dot-com crash and steadily grew into a nine-figure run rate, only raising $100 million 11 years after getting started.

**Protolabs** does for plastic injection molding what Vistaprint does for business cards and is currently worth $1.2B.

**Cvent**, worth $1.65B, builds event management tools and **Textura**, acquired for $663M, handles construction management—neither typically considered a hot or hip market.

**Grasshopper** is a phone networking company that had 150,000 customers, over $30 million in annual revenue, but no VC on the books, and was eventually acquired by Citrix.

**eClinicalWorks** was founded in 1999 when the mantra was "get big fast," and many of its contemporaries crashed and burned. By focusing on excelling at the dull, yet profitable work of managing clinical data, the company survived and now employs over 4,000 workers and generates $320 million dollars in annual revenue.

**Zoho:** 4,000 FTEs. 18M customers. $300M+ in revenue. Not bad for a bootstrapped startup taking on Oracle and Salesforce!

**Datto:** Founded in 2007 by running up $80K in credit card debt, this data storage startup company is now valued at over a billion dollars and is the only unicorn based in Connecticut.

**InsideSales.com:** Started in 2004 with a $10,000 investment, the AI service provider to internal sales team has grown to 570 FTEs. It waited eight years to raise its first $4M in 2012 and has raised over a quarter billion dollars to date.

**JetBrains:** A Prague-based developer of the leading JAVA IDE and the Kotlin programming language has grown a list of 230,000 paying customers, signed up 431 of the Fortune 500, and employs 691 people—all without the benefit of venture capital.

**Unity** became a backbone of the mobile gaming industry by focusing on all of the unsexy aspects of game development, like cross-platform compatibility and "bump mapping." They went years without raising capital, but now have a valuation over $1.5B, and are more successful than the majority of branded game startups.

**GitHub** took the pain out of version control and became a critical part of the tech ecosystem before raising capital.

**Qualtrics** started as a tool to administer surveys for schools and businesses in a basement in Utah and now employs 1,000 and rakes in $100 million dollars a year, profitably.

**Wistia:** Corporate training videos are famously lifeless, the only thing that could be more boring is a startup dedicated to hosting them. Despite a dull as dishwater market, Wistia has managed to build an 80 person team that serves 300,000 customers including Starbucks, Cirque Du Soleil, and Casper.

**The lesson:** Solve real problems. Get paid. Build sustainably. "Boring" problems often have less competition and more willingness to pay.
