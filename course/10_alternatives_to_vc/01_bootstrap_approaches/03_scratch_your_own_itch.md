# Scratch Your Own Itch

**Many entrepreneurs waste their time "playing CEO," crafting a strategy and drawing up a dream org chart for what their business might become. The best founders avoid daydreams and focus on what can be done using only the resources at their disposal.**

**SimpliSafe:** People scoff at the idea of trying to bootstrap a hardware business, but SimpliSafe's Chad Laurans did it. He raised a small amount of money from friends and family and then spent eight years building a self-install security business, literally soldering the first prototypes himself to save money. Eight years later, the business has hundreds of thousands of customers, hundreds of millions in revenue, and $57M in VC from Sequoia.

**Ipsy:** Birchbox pioneered the idea of sending sample boxes of cosmetics to potential customers, but YouTube star Michelle Phan leveraged her online celebrity—8M+ YouTube subscribers—to turn it into a phenomenon. Her audience and relationships with cosmetics brands allowed her to build a subscription box startup that generated $150M in revenue before raising $100M in VC.

**ShutterStock:** Jon Oringer was a professional software developer and an amateur photographer. He combined this set of skills and used 30,000 photos from his personal photo library to start a stock photo service that is currently worth $2 billion dollars. His capital efficiency paid off and ultimately turned him into a truly self-made billionaire.

**Quizlet:** While not the biggest business on this list by any stretch, Quizlet is notable in that it was founded by a precocious 15-year-old who wanted to ace his French final. By the time Quizlet raised a Series A in 2012, it had a 22-year-old CEO, 40M users and was a top 50 website in the US.

**Skyscanner:** The company started as a bespoke spreadsheet to help its founder find the best flight prices and has since become Edinburgh's leading tech company with 500+ employees. The company got off the ground under its own power in 2001, raised $6M in 2007, and $192M in 2016, fifteen years after launching.

**The lesson:** Start with what you have. Use what you know. Solve problems you actually face. Then see if others have the same problem.
