# Automate Your Workflow

**The easiest way to build a useful product is to automate some part of your daily workflow.** This ensures you've got proven demand for your product and a pre-existing funding source.

**MailChimp:** In the year 2000, co-founder/CEO Ben Chestnut was running a design consulting business and had a stream of clients who wanted email newsletters created. The only problem was that he hated designing them. So, to spare his team the tedium, he decided to build a tool that would streamline the process and MailChimp, a $400M business, was born.

**Lynda:** In the late 1990s, Lynda Weinman was teaching web design, but the technical books she assigned to her class were bland, so she began producing training films for her students. She spent the next two decades building a content library and tech assets that had scale sufficient to entice Linkedin to pay $1.5 billion dollars to acquire the company.

**PluralSight:** Like Lynda.com, PluralSight offers remote software training. It bootstrapped for its first nine years and now offers 6,000 courses on everything from C# to Javascript, and is an IPO candidate with a billion dollar valuation.

**Instead of trying to compete with a company like Apple, these scrappy startups filled the gap left by RadioShack and built multi-million dollar businesses worthy of emulation.**

**AdaFruit Industries:** Limor Fried started her DIY electronics ecommerce empire as a student at MIT by assembling DIY kits comprised of off-the-shelf parts. Fried merchandised the same building blocks found at electronics stores but also crafted quirky content that made the prospect of soldering a replica Space Invaders cabinet seem reasonable. Now, she has 85 employees and earns $33 million per year.

**SparkFun:** Similar to AdaFruit, Nathan Seidle started Sparkfun from his dorm room by selling electronics kits and oddball components to engineers who wanted to explore exotic new sensors and systems. Now, his ecommerce empire employs 150+ and has revenues of $32 million dollars per year.

**Old Problem + Existing Business Model + New Tech = $$$

Solving an old problem with a new technology or UX layer can be enough to build a multi-billion dollar business.**

**Shopify:** Shopify's founders were searching for a shopping cart solution when they were setting up an ecommerce site for snowboarders. Unable to find one, they decided to scratch their own itch and built a bespoke solution on the then red-hot Ruby on Rails framework. It turned out to be a perfect solution for plenty more people, and the founders ran the business independently for six years on the revenue they generated. They ultimately raised money from VCs and later IPOed, which rewarded them with a fourteen-billion dollar valuation.

**Braintree Payments:** Exchanging money online, without being fleeced by fraudsters, is one of the oldest problems on the web. Braintree built a better tech solution to serve as a tollbooth for buyers and sellers and survived on the proceeds of those transactions for four years before raising $69 million in two rounds of venture capital which preceded an $800 million dollar acquisition.
