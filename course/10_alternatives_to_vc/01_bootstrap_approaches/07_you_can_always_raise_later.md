# You Can Always Raise Later

**Putting off raising capital pays off in mind blowing ways.**

**Wayfair:** The home goods ecommerce company was profitable from its first month of operation and grew profitably for a decade until they ultimately raised a Series A—worth $165 million dollars—shortly before going public. The company is currently worth $6 billion dollars and because they suffered little dilution, the founders are worth a billion dollars each!

**Zip Recruiter:** "We started out with humble ambitions, to bootstrap a lifestyle business," said Co-founder/CEO Ian Siegel in an interview with Alex Konrad from Forbes. Those ambitions were met, superseded, and as the recruiting platform continued to grow the founders decided to raise a $63M series A to tackle more ambitious plans.

**Nerdwallet:** The personal finance service that promises to help young people save money lived on a tight budget from the time it was founded in 2009 until it a raised $64M series A in 2015. The company earned a $500M valuation based on $100M+ in annual revenue, though it recently had to tighten its belt with a small layoff.

**Blessed are the Unfundable**

A benefit of starting a business outside of a startup hub is that there isn't much VC available. This may sound like a curse, but it can be a blessing in disguise. Unable to daydream about deploying capital, entrepreneurs are forced to make their paying customers happy.

**Atlassian:** Atlassian, based in Australia, bootstrapped its way to a $13 billion dollar market cap, but if it had easier access to funding, the team might have chased low-quality growth and gone under before they figured out how to scale efficiently.

**Campaign Monitor:** When a company's first round of funding looks more like proceeds from an IPO, you know you're dealing with efficient entrepreneurs. This is the case for Campaign Monitor, a Sydney-based startup who offers superior email analytics to companies like Disney, Coca-Cola, and Buzzfeed and whose first round of funding amounted to $250 million dollars.

**The Trade Desk:** While he had a unique view of how to power the programmatic advertising industry, founder Jeff Green started The Trade Desk late in the funding cycle for modern AdTech. This overcapitalization of the market, combined with investors getting burned by bad performers made every round of funding a struggle throughout the life of the company. Green was a consummate startup CEO, who raised only $26.4M in venture capital during the company's first six years, and turned it into a billion-dollar business traded on the NASDAQ.

**AppLovin:** It is shockingly common to hear founders talk about how they couldn't sell investors on an idea that went on to become a billion-dollar business. Before selling his company for $1.4B, AppLovin founder Adam Foroughi said, "I couldn't find anyone to give us an investment at what I thought was a reasonable starting point valuation (maybe $4 million or $5 million) and, by the end of our first year of operations, we were profitable and doing over $1 million a month in revenue." The rest, as they say, is history.

**The lesson:** Sometimes being "unfundable" forces you to build something real. And when you do raise later, you'll have much better leverage, less dilution, and a proven business model.
