- **Key Concepts:** VC funding as confession of failure, selling company parts, building to sell vs building to keep, second-order effects (hiring pressure, time on fundraising, large markets, customer acquisition over satisfaction, profitability takes back seat), feedback loop of profitability, arbitrary metrics, political discussions, bootstrapping alternatives, consulting as starting point
- **Key Insight:** VC funding is not a success—it's a confession that you haven't figured out how to make your company profitable. Once you take it, your company's objective fundamentally changes: you're no longer building your company the way you like it. You're building to sell. The feedback loop of profitability is the most important feedback loop any business can have. Once you lose that loop, you lose your compass.
