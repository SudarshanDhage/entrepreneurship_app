# Why VC Funding Destroys Companies

**VC funding is not a success—it's a confession of failure.** You're admitting that you haven't figured out how to make your company profitable with the resources you currently have. You're bleeding money, and you need more.

This is a critical perspective that challenges the conventional startup narrative. Here's why taking VC funding fundamentally changes—and often destroys—what you're trying to build.

## What VC Funding Actually Is

When a company "receives 10 million Euros in VC funding," what actually happened? **You sold a part of your company for 10 million Euros.** 

That's it. You and your co-founders were running your company, and things were going reasonably well—except for one problem: **Your company was not profitable.**

In ancient times, when Peter Drucker was writing business books, the definition of a successful company actually included the fact that the company was making more money than it was spending. That definition seems to have been forgotten, and nowadays success is judged by totally arbitrary metrics—maybe the amount of customers, or the speed at which that customer base is growing. Business people call it "traction," but having traction doesn't magically make your company profitable.

**If you spend more money than you make, you're screwed. And once you're screwed, that's where VC funding comes in, and in all likelihood, it screws you even more.**

## VC Funding Means You Will Sell Your Company

Remember: VC investors want to make a lot more money. They'll buy a certain percentage of your company—say, 10% for 10 million Euros. Their plan is to sell this percentage for a higher price in the future—maybe 1,000 million Euros, that would be a 100x return.

Now, here's the inevitable consequence: **Once you've taken VC funding, the objective of your company has changed.** You're no longer building your company the way you like it. You're building your and the VCs company so that they can sell it, for a price higher than the one they paid. There are no alternatives. The course is set. **You're building to sell.**

If you had any romanticized notion of building the company of your dreams with your employees becoming your best friends or family, well, now's the time to let go of those ideas, because you're about to sell your family for a lot of money.

## Second-Order Effects

Taking VC funding leads to several destructive second-order effects:

### You Have to Hire Lots of People

Because your goal is to sell the company later, it has to grow. That means you will hire lots of people even though you might not want to hire them. You might prefer to work with 10 employees, but a company with 10 employees is not very valuable. You'll have to hire many, many more.

Besides the obvious effect that your company becomes much slower as many more meetings have to take place, you'll also hire people who are not perfect fits for your team—because you're hiring for growth, not for fit.

### You'll Spend Most of Your Time Finding the Next Investors

Your funding only lasts so long, say, two years or so. Before that time is up, you'll have to go and look for new funding again. That might take six to twelve months. So you're spending 25%–50% of your time chasing down investors instead of doing what you actually wanted to do: building your company and your product.

You'll have to trust your employees to do that for you. Maybe that will work. But is that the setup you wanted?

### You Have to Focus on Large Markets

You might encounter the opportunity of building a niche product for a small market—like, appointment scheduling software for psychotherapists in Berlin. Sure, that might make some psychotherapists very happy and it might make you enough money to pay five employees. But it will make nowhere near enough money to pay for five hundred employees, and that's what your VC investors want.

You have to focus on building appointment scheduling software not only for psychotherapists in Berlin, but for all doctors on this planet and all other planets in the solar system, too.

### Making Existing Customers Happy Becomes Less Important

Your existing customers might be reasonably happy with your product. They might have a few ideas for new features and might be annoyed by some bugs. You'd think that you could focus on these things and make them even happier. But no, your priorities are different now—making existing customers happy doesn't increase your revenue in a way that grows your company fast enough.

You have to focus on acquiring new customers. Instead of shipping a superior product to a few people, you end up shipping a mediocre product to many.

### Profitability Takes a Back Seat

**This is the biggest problem.** Let's imagine a successful, old-school business—say, a restaurant. At the end of every month, you get a solid indication whether you're profitable by checking your bank account. If there's more money in it than the prior month, you probably made a profit. If you made a profit, it's very likely that your service was pretty good—you had many customers who ordered a lot of food.

If your service deteriorates, maybe because your food sucks, then you'll likely have less customers, make less money, and be less profitable. You'll realize this and think "damn, what's going on, we need to improve something here."

This **"feedback loop of profitability"** is, in my opinion, the most important feedback loop any business can ever have. It constantly forces you to question whether you're doing the right thing. And "doing the right thing" usually means how you spend your time, and how you spend your money.

In your restaurant, would it make sense for your chef to spend their first six months on building a stove? No, that doesn't make a lot of sense—your chef should instead be preparing food. Buy the stove, don't build it yourself.

Yet, at VC-backed software startups, I see software engineers spending months on building "internal tooling" without shipping an actual product.

In your restaurant, would it make sense to purchase gold-plated toilets for the bathrooms? No, that doesn't make a lot of sense because those won't bring in more customers. Good food, however, will.

Yet, at VC-backed software startups, I've seen insane purchases. Phone booths for 10k€ a piece? No problem. Hiring a boutique designer firm to redesign your WordPress website for 50k€? Sure.

Besides losing whatever remnant of cost control you had, the implications are even wider. Do people even know what to work on once the profitability feedback loop disappears? From my experience, no. **People work on completely arbitrary things and everyone ends up chasing their own tail.**

One quarter the priority is "we need to ship our product", the next quarter it's "our investors want us to have customers, so let's have some customers", and after that it might be "no one is using our software, but our investors want to see traction, so let's generate some traction".

None of these are connected to profitability. Worse yet, these arbitrary metrics lead to even weirder things, for example handing out your product for free to show your investors that you have customers. So your arbitrary priorities might actually endanger your profitability.

Because priorities aren't clear, discussions and meetings in your company also won't be clear. People will no longer discuss things of immediate urgency, like in the restaurant ("why does our food suck?")—instead, discussion topics will be all over the place, like which coffee machine to buy, which great feature was recently shipped (yet totally irrelevant), which rockstar developer you hired, or whose feature idea gets implemented next. **Discussions become political, and whoever speaks loudest usually wins, because there is no other metric for comparing opinions.**

## "But My Company Is Only Possible With Funding!"

You might say "all of your points make sense, but my company is only possible with VC funding because it has huge up-front costs".

Think again whether that's really true. Yes, some companies might truly have huge up-front costs and therefore require investments—like if you want to build cars or shoot rockets to Mars. But, besides those two examples, most other real-world companies are less capital intensive and you might be surprised by how many options you have for bootstrapping it yourself.

One favorite method is to start with consulting. Want to start a medical software company? Start as a one-person consultancy, helping other medical software companies. You'll learn tons about medical software and build a great network of people. Most importantly, you'll learn about the problems those companies are facing. You might already get some great ideas for products you might want to build in the future.

Once you've saved some money, hire your first employee. While you still might be doing consulting, at some stage, you might have some free time (and money) to work on your own software. You try to sell it to your existing consulting customers. Some may buy. And then hire the next person. And so on.

Most product-based businesses can be "projectified" to something more akin to consulting. Give it a try. You'll learn many things along the way which will be invaluable later on—meeting other companies in the industry and learning about their products, finding a good tax advisor, hiring and managing people, and yes... being profitable.

## The Bottom Line

**Don't take VC funding** unless you're truly building something that requires massive capital upfront (like rockets or cars) and you're fully aware that you're building to sell, not building to keep.

The feedback loop of profitability is the most important feedback loop any business can have. It constantly forces you to question whether you're doing the right thing. Once you lose that loop, you lose your compass. Priorities become arbitrary. People work on random things. Discussions become political. And your company, which might have been on a path to sustainable success, becomes a ship adrift—growing fast, burning money, but with no clear destination or means of navigation.

**Remember: VC funding is not a success—it's a confession that you haven't figured out how to be profitable. And once you take it, your company's objective fundamentally changes: you're no longer building your company the way you like it. You're building to sell.**
