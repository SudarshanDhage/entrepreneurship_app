# Money is Like Gasoline

**"Money is like gasoline on a road trip. You don't want to run out of gas on your trip, but you're not doing a tour of gas stations."**

This simple metaphor captures the proper relationship between funding and building a company.

Money is a means to an end—a resource that enables your journey, not the journey itself. Just as you need gas to drive, you need money to build. But the goal is to reach your destination, not to accumulate more and more gas stations along the way.

Many founders get this backwards. They become obsessed with fundraising, treating each funding round as a milestone of success. But raising money isn't success—building a profitable, sustainable business is.

**Focus on where you're going, not on refueling.**
