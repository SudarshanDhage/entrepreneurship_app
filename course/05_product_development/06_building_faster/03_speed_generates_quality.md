# Speed Generates Quality

A counterintuitive guiding principle in effective product development culture: speed in learning generates quality.

## The Ceramics Teacher Story

A ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups:
- **Quantity group (left side):** Would be graded solely on the quantity of work produced — fifty pounds of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on
- **Quality group (right side):** Would be graded solely on quality — needed to produce only one pot, albeit a perfect one, to get an "A"

**The surprising result:** When grading time came, the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.

Why? While the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

## The Counterintuitive Principle

**Speed creates more opportunities for learning; learning generates quality.**

The mistake is believing that being more careful, taking longer to produce things, is what creates quality. This is sub-optimal because certain kinds of knowledge can only be acquired by releasing and making contact with the problem you're trying to solve.

## Two Approaches

**Approach 1 (Quality First):** "Be very careful," "do it right the first time," "people need to love the first version"
- Leads to theorizing about perfection
- Little to show for efforts
- Misses learning opportunities

**Approach 2 (Speed First):** "Shorten the learning loop," "make sure failure doesn't kill us"
- Produces more iterations
- More opportunities to learn from mistakes
- Generates better quality in the end

## What Speed Really Means

This isn't mindless speed (aka "move fast and break things") but rather **shortening learning loops**.

**Learning faster is not about rushing; learning faster is about making things safer and smoother.**

**Key distinction:** Smooth from the perspective of the "baton" (the work) is not equivalent to smooth from the perspective of the "runner" (the worker). Smooth from the perspective of the "baton" has more impact on organizational learning speed.

Focus on making the work flow smoothly through the system, not just on making individuals work faster.

## Implications

- Don't optimize for "perfect first version" — optimize for fast learning cycles
- Create safety so failures don't kill you, enabling faster iteration
- Focus on smooth flow of work through the system, not just individual speed
- Remember that the fastest path to quality is through many cycles of learning, not through careful planning of a single attempt
