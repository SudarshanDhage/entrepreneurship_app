# How to Hire a Product Manager

The classic essay that defined the product manager role. Originally published in 2005 and updated in 2023, this essay has been read millions of times and launched thousands of PM careers.

## The Reality of Product Management

Product management may be the one job that the organization would get along fine without (at least for a good while). Without engineers, nothing would get built. Without sales people, nothing is sold. Without designers, the product looks like crap. But in a world without PMs, everyone simply fills in the gap and goes on with their lives.

**It's important to remember that—as a PM, you're expendable.** Now, in the long run great product management usually makes the difference between winning and losing, but you have to prove it.

Product management also combines elements of lots of other specialties—engineering, design, marketing, sales, business development. Product management is a weird discipline full of oddballs and rejects that never quite fit in anywhere else.

## What to Look For: Six Key Characteristics

### 1. Hire All the Smart People

Most importantly, **raw intellectual horsepower.** Take a wickedly smart, inexperienced PM over one of average intellect and years of experience any day.

Product management is fundamentally about:
- Thinking on your feet
- Staying one step ahead of your competitors
- Being able to project yourself into the minds of your colleagues and your customers

**Interview approach:** Ask analytical questions to gauge intelligence and problem-solving ability. Ask questions until you're sure the candidate is smarter than you.

**The first test:** How do they react when you say "I'd like to pose some theoretical problems, is that okay?" The best are usually bouncing out of their chairs with excitement. The super smart sometimes counter with questions of their own.

**Update (2023):** Please don't ask "brainteaser" or logic puzzle questions. Most strong product companies have moved toward structured interviews that emphasize work samples and situational problems that don't have a "right answer."

### 2. Strong Technical Background

Some managers insist on hiring only PMs with computer science degrees. Not necessarily required, but favor people who've been in technical roles.

**Why it matters:**
- Ability to relate to engineers
- Grasp of the technical details driving the product

It depends on the product of course—a PM working on low-level developer APIs needs more technical chops than one working on the front-end of a personals web site. But the basic principle applies: product managers with technical backgrounds will have more success conveying product requirements to engineers and relaying complicated details to non-technical colleagues and customers.

**Critical pitfall to avoid:** A PM who's a former engineer needs to realize that he or she is just that—a former engineer. PMs who come from engineering and still try to take charge of technical decisions and implementation details will crash spectacularly.

For that reason, prefer hiring technical people who've already made the move to product management at a previous job. They've already gone through the challenging adaptation period.

**Good interview questions for technical PMs:**
- Why did you decide to move from engineering to product management?
- What is the biggest advantage of having a technical background?
- What is the biggest disadvantage?
- What was the biggest lesson you learned when you moved from engineering to product management?
- What do you wish you'd known when you were an engineer?
- How do you earn the respect of the engineering team?

### 3. "Spidey-Sense" Product Instincts and Creativity

This category is highly subjective, difficult to evaluate, and extraordinarily important.

**Certain people are born with innate product instincts.** These people just know what makes a great product. They're not always right, but their instincts usually point in the right direction. They tend to be passionate advocates of a point of view, sometimes to the chagrin of their colleagues.

Product management, especially in highly dynamic environments like the web, involves lots of small decisions. Sure, there's a lot of big thinking and strategy. But it's the little decisions where a great PM distances themself from a decent one.

You know they've got the "spidey-sense" product instinct when they suggest approaches that nobody on the team has thought of, but immediately strike everyone as obvious when they hear them.

**Evaluating product instinct in an interview — check if the candidate has:**

1. **Independently echoed some of your own concerns about your product** — If you're a good PM, you've got a bunch of things that worry you about your own product. Maybe they're UI shortcomings, missing features, or architecture flaws that need to be addressed. At least some of these should be obvious to an intelligent outsider with strong product instincts.

2. **Taught you something new about your product** — It could be an obvious improvement you'd never considered, a new idea for positioning against a competitor, or a problem they encountered that needs to be addressed. When you learn something from a candidate, you know two things: (1) they're not afraid to speak critically, and (2) they're probably smarter than you.

3. **Turned you on to something new and interesting** — People with great product instincts tend to notice great products before everyone else. If you're interviewing a top-notch candidate, you usually walk away having discovered something new and innovative.

**Interview questions for judging product instincts:**
- Tell me about a great product you've encountered recently. Why do you like it? [Note: It drives me crazy when candidates name one of my products in an interview.]
- What's made [insert product here] successful? [Pick a popular product, like the iPod or eBay.]
- What do you dislike about my product? How would you improve it?
- What problems are we going to encounter in a year? Two years? Ten years?
- How do you know a product is well designed?
- What's one of the best ideas you've ever had?
- What is one of the worst?
- How do you know when to cut corners to get a product out the door?
- What lessons have you learned about user interface design?
- How do you decide what not to build?
- What was your biggest product mistake?
- What aspects of product management do you find the least interesting and why?
- Do you consider yourself creative?

**Update (2023):** Since the original essay, product designers have ascended to become the "third leg of the stool" alongside PMs and engineers. One way to evaluate design sensibility and product instincts is to include product designers in the interview loop.

### 4. Leadership That's Earned

Product managers are usually leaders in their organizations. But they typically don't have direct line authority over others. That means **they earn their authority and lead by influence.**

Leadership and interpersonal skills are critical for product management.

**Reference checks are the most effective way to measure leadership skills**, especially references that involve peers and individual contributors who worked with—but did not report to—the candidate.

**Interview questions for leadership:**
- Is consensus always a good thing?
- What's the difference between management and leadership?
- What kinds of people do you like to work with?
- What types of people have you found it difficult to work with?
- Tell me about a time when a team didn't gel. Why do you think that happened, and what have you learned?
- How do you get a team to commit to a schedule?
- What would somebody do to lose your confidence?
- Do you manage people from different functions differently? If so, how?
- What have you learned about saying no?
- Who has the ultimate accountability for shipping a product?
- Have you ever been in a situation where your team has let you down and you've had to take the blame?
- How has your tolerance for mistakes changed over the years?
- Which do you like first, the good news or the bad news?
- What's your approach to hiring?

### 5. Ability to Channel Multiple Points-of-View

Being a product manager requires wearing multiple hats. Much of the time your job is to be the advocate for whoever isn't currently in the room—the customer, engineering, sales, executives, marketing.

That means you need to be capable of doing other people's jobs, but smart enough to know not to. Great PMs know how to channel different points-of-view. They play devil's advocate a lot. They tend to be unsatisfied with simple answers.

**How to evaluate this:** Get lots of people in the interview process. At a minimum, representatives from engineering, design, and marketing should meet a potential PM candidate. Depending on the specific role, this list can grow—pre-sales engineering, support, developer relations, business development, legal, or customers themselves.

Ultimately anyone who will be working with this person should meet them. One carefully selected representative of each key function will suffice. And it doesn't mean everybody has to give a thumbs-up—it's hard to build consensus in an interview process as the list of interviewers grows.

But nobody will be able to judge how well a product manager understands the sales process like a salesperson.

**Give specific instructions to interviewers:** "I'd like you to see how well this person would understand the issues you face in channel development, and how well they'd support you in the field."

**Interview questions (examples, feel free to replace functional names):**
- How have you learned to work with sales?
- What is the best way to interface with customers?
- What makes marketing tick?
- How do you know when design is on the right track?
- How should a product manager support business development?
- What have you learned about managing up?
- What's the best way to work with the executives?

### 6. Give Me Someone Who's Shipped Something

This last characteristic may be the easiest to evaluate. Unless the position is very junior, hire product managers who've actually shipped a product. From start to finish, concept to launch.

**Nothing is a better indication of someone's ability to ship great products than having done it before.** Past performance is an indication of future success. Even better, it gives something tangible to evaluate in a sea of intangibles.

When checking references, always make sure to talk to important colleagues from a previous project, especially the PM's manager and their engineering and sales or marketing counterparts.

**Note:** These rules are ordered for a reason. A brilliantly smart PM is preferred over a dimmer experienced one even if the former hasn't shipped before.

## Startup vs. Big Company

**At a startup:**
- Everyone does a little of everything, so you need strong generalists
- Hard to predict the future, so you need people who can adapt
- You might think you're hiring somebody to work on something specific, but that something might change in a few months

**At big companies:**
- Usually when you're hiring you have a very specific role in mind
- The likelihood that that responsibility will change is low
- Lots of people hired at big companies probably wouldn't have been appropriate at a startup

**Deadly thinking at a startup:** "Well, I'm not sure they're the perfect candidate, but they do seem suited for this very specific role, so let's hire them." That may work fine at a big company, but it's deadly at a startup.
