# Musk's 5-Step Design Process

A systematic approach to efficient engineering and product development, revealed by Elon Musk as the process SpaceX aims to "apply rigorously."

## The 5 Steps

**Musk's 5-Step Design Process** consists of:
1. Make the requirements less dumb
2. Delete the part or process
3. Simplify or optimize the design
4. Accelerate cycle time
5. Automate

This process was revealed by Musk in an interview when asked about the grid fins of his latest rocket design. The process led SpaceX to discover that grid fins didn't need to fold back—deleting that requirement eliminated the need for massive mechanisms.

## Step 1: Make the Requirements Less Dumb

**"Your requirements are definitely dumb, it does not matter who gave them to you."**

Musk uses this step to test assumptions, pointing out that requirements from a "smart person" are often the most dangerous since you might not question them enough.

**Action:** Question the question. Challenge and question requirements, no matter who gave them to you. Similar to Framestorming—don't accept requirements at face value.

**Key insight:** Requirements from smart people are especially dangerous because you might not question them enough.

## Step 2: Delete the Part or Process

**"If you're not adding things back in at least 10% of the time, you're clearly not deleting enough."**

Musk suggests starting lean and building up when and if required, but warns that the bias will be to add things "in case."

**Key principles:**
- Start from the core and add when required
- Resist the urge to add things "just in case"—you can make "in case" arguments for so many things
- Each requirement or constraint must be accountable to a person, not a department
- You can ask that person about its relevance and purpose, rather than having a requirement that nobody owns and persists for years despite being redundant

**Action:** Try to start from the core and add when required. Actively look for parts and processes to delete.

**Example:** SpaceX grid fins—they discovered the fins didn't need to fold back, eliminating the need for massive mechanisms.

## Step 3: Simplify or Optimize the Design

**"Possibly the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist."**

Musk emphasizes the importance of working through the first two steps before trying to optimize. To do this effectively, each engineer needs to take a holistic view of the project.

**Example of the mistake:** Engineers invested enormous resources into reducing the weight of the rocket's engine but hadn't adequately addressed the equivalent problem of reducing payload weight.

**Action:** Now that you're answering the right question and have stripped it to the core, you can begin to optimize what you have.

**Key insight:** Take a holistic view—optimizing one part while ignoring related parts is wasteful.

## Step 4: Accelerate Cycle Time

**"If you're digging your grave, don't dig faster."**

Musk embraces the drive to go faster but warns against pointing your efforts in the wrong direction. He recommends an accelerated Agile approach, but only after the first three steps of his process are satisfied to ensure that you're moving faster in the right direction.

**Action:** Knowing you're moving in the right direction, it's time to iterate faster.

**Key insight:** Speed only helps if you're going in the right direction. Complete steps 1-3 first.

## Step 5: Automate

**Warning:** Don't automate before the earlier points are addressed.

Musk relates the story of streamlining a robotic process to build battery mats in the Tesla Model 3. He describes investing massive time and effort to automate and streamline that problematic process before he finally asked what the mat was for. He discovered that it had been created to reduce sound but was no longer required.

**Action:** Finally, consider how to automate processes moving forward—but only after you've worked through steps 1-4.

**Key insight:** Automating the wrong thing is worse than not automating at all.

## In Practice

This approach stems from an engineering perspective to streamline and rethink rocket design but can be applied to almost any design project—from UX, to marketing campaigns, to product design more broadly.

**Examples from Tesla and SpaceX:**
- Grid fins that don't fold back (simplified design)
- Battery mat automation that was unnecessary (should have been deleted first)
- Rocket engine weight optimization without considering payload weight (needed holistic view)

## Connections to Other Mental Models

Elements of Musk's process reflect:
- **First Principle Thinking** — consistently challenging assumptions
- **Framestorming** — questioning the question
- **Occam's Razor** — seeking the simplest solution
- **Lean Startup & MVP** — Musk refers to a "Minimum Viable Rocket"
- **Addition by Subtraction** — simplifying by removing

The rejection of including more and more features "in case" counters the Redundancy/Margin of Error model when applied incorrectly.

## Limitations

As a high-level approach, there's not too much to disagree with. The challenge will come in the application.

Musk describes it as a linear process, starting with the first three stages to ensure you're addressing the right question. In complex design applications, you may need to cycle back and forth through the process as new requirements are uncovered or old ones are refined.

## The Process in Order

**Critical:** The order matters. You must work through steps 1-3 before accelerating or automating:

1. ✅ **Make requirements less dumb** — Ensure you're solving the right problem
2. ✅ **Delete parts/processes** — Strip to the core
3. ✅ **Simplify/optimize** — Optimize what remains
4. ✅ **Accelerate cycle time** — Now that direction is right, go faster
5. ✅ **Automate** — Finally, automate the streamlined process

Skipping steps or doing them out of order leads to optimizing the wrong thing or automating inefficiency.
