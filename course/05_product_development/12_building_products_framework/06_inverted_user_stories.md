# As a User, I Don't Want To

Task-oriented user stories lead to bad product decisions because they mix up value with cost. But they are easy to turn into inverted user stories—a tool for thinking bigger.

## The Problem with Task-Oriented User Stories

Since their invention in 1997, user stories have become ubiquitous. The simple format of "as X, I want Y so that I can Z" has helped countless software teams stay focused on the value they are providing for their customers.

**In theory.**

In practice, Scrum manuals and Agile coaches have drilled the format into product owners for decades, to the point that "user story" and "ticket" have become nearly synonymous. In an effort to fit their work into the Scrum process, teams have lost track of what the user story was meant to help them achieve.

### The Degeneration

The user story went from:

> **As [user] I want [to reach a goal] so that I can [obtain a benefit]**

to:

> **As [user] I want [to do a task] so that I can [use the tool]**

**Examples of corrupted user stories:**
- I want to click the button so that I can see the page
- I want to enter my email so that I can receive exclusive offers
- I want to fill out form 1234-A so that I can fill in line 5 on form 5678-B
- Sometimes, even the "so that" is missing entirely: *As a user, I want to log in*

## The Truth

**I don't want to use a product at all.**

The ideal user experience is that I reach my goal without doing any work. The original user story format reminded us of this by staying focused purely on the goal. Task-oriented user stories replaced the goal with the work: all downside without any of the benefits.

## What's So Bad About Tasks?

### Value vs. Cost

The most important thing about the original user story format is that it outlined a **benefit**, for which users might be willing to pay. The product team would be free to figure out both how to provide the benefit and what its costs might be—including the cost of dealing with increased product complexity that users would have to face.

But **tasks, tools, and features are not benefits**. Doing a task or using a tool is one of the **costs** that the user has to pay to achieve their goal. Adding features to your product degrades the experience because it increases that cost.

When the complexity cost of physical products exceeds the value, users have a way out. With software, they just leave.

### The Hidden Problem

Rather than helping the team make these trade-offs, task-oriented user stories make them harder by obfuscating the lack of value to the user. Asserting "as a user, I want to fill out the form" fools the team into thinking that the user will give the product something for nothing. The cost is hidden because the user is *defined* as someone who wants to fill out forms, even if no such person actually exists.

With a user story like that, every ticket becomes self-justifying. Features multiply, complexity rises. The value to the user plummets but teams cannot see it because they are constantly telling themselves that they are building what the user wants.

## The Solution: Invert the User Story

A task-oriented user story contains two useful pieces of information, hidden behind inaccurate labels:
- What it calls the benefit is actually **the cost**
- What it calls the goal is a **solution hypothesis**

We can make use of this information to craft a new type of user story.

### Example

**Task-oriented user story:**
> As a user, I want to customize my toolbar so that I can optimize my browsing experience.

**Recognizing that we are looking at a cost**, we can ask ourselves: is there a way for us to remove that cost?

**Inverted user story:**
> As a user, I want to optimize my browsing experience **without having to** customize my toolbar.

Rather than taking for granted that the user should bear the burden of editing their own toolbar, the team can now think about what a better, less costly experience might look like. Instead of making it easier to customize the toolbar, we can skip directly to the real benefit.

### Benefits of Inversion

1. **Uncovers the real goal** — Focus shifts from the task to the desired outcome
2. **Highlights the hypothesis** — The feature idea is revealed as a hypothesis that needs validation
3. **Encourages innovation** — Opens up space to explore better solutions
4. **Reduces complexity** — Challenges the assumption that more features are needed

This framing also highlights that the feature idea is, in reality, a hypothesis. Do users actually want to optimize their browsing experience? In what ways? A team that writes task-oriented user stories is stuck with their assumptions. A team prepared to invert their user stories is now equipped to actually find out.

## Working Backwards (Amazon's Approach)

It's easy to write task-oriented user stories, because they usually don't describe innovative capabilities. Rather, they capture an existing pattern so well-known that it becomes obvious. *Of course* our users want to customize the toolbar! How else would they optimize their browsing experience?

If a user benefit brings an obvious feature to mind, chances are that it's a feature that already exists somewhere else. But like all features, it represents a cost. And an existing cost is a great place to find pain points.

Rather than copying their competition, the team that inverts its user stories has identified an opportunity to get ahead of them. Amazon takes a similar approach to highlighting pain points in its press releases, with a slightly different phrasing: **"today, customers have to…"**.

"Today, customers have to customize the toolbar if they want to improve their browsing experience" sounds much more like a struggle than a feature you should build on purpose. Interrupting the rush to add a new ticket to the backlog has now turned into an opportunity to innovate and differentiate your product in the market.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Original user stories focused on goals and benefits** — "As X, I want [goal] so that I can [benefit]"
2. **Task-oriented user stories focus on work and tools** — "As X, I want [task] so that I can [use tool]"
3. **Tasks and features are costs, not benefits** — Adding features increases complexity cost
4. **Invert task-oriented stories** — Change "I want to do X" to "I want Y without having to do X"
5. **This reveals the real goal and highlights assumptions** — Opens up better solution space
6. **Use "today, customers have to..." framing** — Similar to Amazon's working backwards approach
