# Startups Don't Need Product Managers Who Are Visionaries

Startups don't need a product manager striving to be a visionary. Instead, they get maximum benefit from someone who focuses less on the glamour and invention and more on empowering teams to build the most impactful product possible.

## Be a Street Sweeper

At its core, being a great product manager is about **clearing the path for everyone else on the team** to set them up for success. Many of those tasks are mundane, but they're vital.

**Example: International product rollout**

On a team at Google, they scaled and rolled out a mobile product in more than 10 countries over 18 months. On its face, that sounds exciting: international travel, different languages, unique market dynamics. In truth, the product manager role required focusing on tactical considerations such as:
- International finance law
- Translation services
- Minute details like how to account for languages whose characters were too large for a specific screen size

To successfully enter new markets, the team dealt not with traversing new geographies, but instead with crossing the rough terrain of various government entities and their approval processes. Without those conversations about font size or finance law, they never would have gotten the product off the ground.

When managers spend their time dreaming up the next great global product, they often aren't addressing the more mundane—but critical—tasks in front of the team. Their refusal to sweep the street—or worse, their belief that they're above that—can lead to ineffective processes that result in delayed product development and deployment.

## Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize

**Example: Feature development**

One team was working on a product feature, and they knew there were a number of different capabilities with which they could experiment. Initially, they adopted a visionary approach: They wanted to include complicated, sophisticated capabilities in pursuit of what they felt would be a complete feature. Their initial goal was to bring a full vision to life by including all the bells and whistles.

But they quickly realized that they needed more of a street sweeper mentality: They had to clear the road of the complicated capabilities of the full vision and instead prioritize building the simplest version of the feature.

If they had taken a visionary approach, they never would have been happy with the product concept, and they likely never would have launched the feature. They would have prioritized the idea of the product feature rather than the minimum viable product (MVP) needed for launch.

Visionary product managers will always be drawn towards the revolutionary and idyllic products or features rather than the evolutionary. Instead, they must be comfortable:
- Asking what the most important features are
- Prioritizing the necessary and often less-flashy capabilities required
- Accepting that may mean a more iterative rollout or slimmer product as a result

## Embrace What You Don't Know

People exaggerate both their strengths and weaknesses, a human dissonance that occurs often. A product manager will typically come from either a technical or non-technical background, further polarizing any dissonance that already exists.

**Example: Technical PM writing code**

One product manager had a technical background and often would try to advance development by writing code instead of sweeping the street for their team. This ended up slowing the development process quite a bit, because the manager using their time to code rather than facilitate was a poor use of resources. Furthermore, this type of behavior can suggest an air of knowing better than the rest of the team, which only propagates the poor allocation of resources in the first place.

A visionary product manager might feel they have all the answers due to their specific background. Yet, in practice, **how well a manager fills their knowledge gaps matters much more.**

Great product managers must:
- Surround themselves with people who have expertise in subject matter areas like designing, building, marketing, and distributing products
- Embrace the knowledge of those experts
- Not make decisions beyond their area of expertise
- Avoid leaning too heavily on what they're familiar with

## Build Mutually Respectful Relationships

**Important advice from a mentor at Google:** PMs should [almost] always let everyone else take the credit while they take the blame.

Letting others take credit is important not just because it makes everyone feel good. It's important because when a product manager expends energy trying to show visionary greatness, that display can damage the morale and motivation of their team.

Visionary product managers who don't sweep streets will instead get in the way of their team's efforts. Managers who spend time trying to dream up an idyllic product vision will:
- Slow down the development process
- Silence other voices in the room (perhaps most importantly)

This behavior is difficult to overcome, as it shows a team that the process is less about building the right product and more about catering to the whims of a product leader and their ego.

Instead, product managers must:
- Give their teammates respect
- Show their appreciation
- Make it clear how much their success is tied to the success of their team

And let's be clear: In practice, it is the team that actually deserves the credit. The PM wasn't the one writing the code, making the designs, or creating the marketing materials. Once the team understands they have the support of the product manager, they will return that trust and support.

## Startups Don't Need a Visionary Product Manager

Visionary product managers will often aim to influence the development cycle in ways that end up being detrimental to the process.

**Startups don't need a visionary product manager.** They need someone who:
- Appreciates their role as street sweeper
- Prioritizes well
- Embraces what they don't know
- Invests in relationships

For product managers, building great functional products is about iterating and supporting a smooth development process.

## For Leadership Teams Hiring a PM

These are the types of questions they should ask of candidates:
- **What does your candidate think their job will be?**
- **Do they see themselves as someone who sits in the back room, closes their eyes, and thinks of the next big thing?**
- **Or do they see themselves as a facilitator?**

Their answer will be telling, because the right approach will go a long way toward engendering sustained success for your company.
