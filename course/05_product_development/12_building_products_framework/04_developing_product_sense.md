# How to Develop Product Sense

Product sense is not only one of the most important PM skills—it's also the most vague. And it's often the hardest to learn. Contrary to what many PMs believe, product sense is not something you need to be born with. It's a learned skill, just like any other PM skill.

## What Exactly Is Product Sense?

**Product sense is the skill of consistently being able to craft products (or make changes to existing products) that have the intended impact on their users.** 

Product sense relies on two core components:
1. **Empathy** to discover meaningful user needs
2. **Creativity** to come up with solutions that effectively address those needs

You likely have good product sense if you've championed successful features or products that were not obvious to others.

**Examples of products born out of strong product sense:**

- **The original iPhone** was built on the insight that people value aesthetics, not just functionality. It was designed around the idea that consumers needed a smartphone that felt personal.
- **The original Gmail** responded to unmet user needs: low storage quotas, poor search experience, and related messages separated from each other instead of being combined in a thread.
- **Superhuman** saw a need for a modern email client to allow busy professionals to get through emails quickly, using thoughtful design to support fast workflows and limit distractions.

## Four Practices for Building Product Sense

### 1. Observe People Interacting with Products

One approach to developing empathy—and thus, product sense—is to repeatedly observe people using products, whether yours or other companies'. This practice helps you get better at identifying subtle user needs that others miss (e.g., social, emotional, or functional needs).

**How to do it:** Start small. Initially, do this two to four times a month for your product. Don't just read reports from researchers; attend user research sessions to get firsthand exposure to user experiences and reactions.

**What to look for:** Pay attention to micro details and ask yourself why people react to your product the way they do. Observe their facial expressions as they try various aspects of your product, and try to spot moments when they're hesitant, confused, excited, etc.

**Key questions to ask:**

1. **What do you think the purpose of this product is? Who do you think it's for?** This gives you a sense of how effective your product's landing page is and ideas for words to describe your product that resonate with people.
2. **Now that you're in the product, what actions do you want to take?** This helps you understand which features are easy to discover and how clear your product's navigation and calls to action are.
3. **What are you thinking right now? How does that make you feel?** Ask this at every new step the user lands on, because people tend not to notice their self-talk and feelings otherwise.

**Example: Slack mobile churn**

When Slack had high churn rates for new users on mobile, user research sessions revealed:
- Many people didn't understand what Slack did, even after visiting the homepage (too abstract)
- People would land in the app and not know what to do because of competing calls to action
- People didn't want to give permission to their mobile address book because it had friends' contact info, not colleagues'

These insights led to experiments that improved the product experience and significantly increased retention.

**Five lessons about product usage:**

1. **People are time-crunched and distracted.** They might not read labels or text and might not be willing to spend even a few seconds to figure out what to do next. Pick the right defaults and use visual design to make primary actions obvious.
2. **People drop out as soon as they feel confused or nervous.** Make sure labels are unambiguous and contrast options appropriately.
3. **Don't give people too much information at once.** Once they feel overwhelmed, they tend to leave. At Slack, moving some pricing information behind dropdowns increased purchases.
4. **Context impacts decisions.** Use tools like comparisons, contrasting, and social proof to make it easier for users to make a decision.
5. **Make the goal of your product and possible actions clear.** One Slack experiment increased mobile retention just by telling new users what Slack is and linking to a video showing how teams use it.

The more frequently and closely you watch people using products, the more observant you'll become and the more empathy you'll develop.

### 2. Deconstruct Everyday Products

Another approach to developing empathy is to observe yourself using everyday products. Spend one or two hours a month trying out new products and deconstructing them. The goal is to strengthen your intuition about why some products work well and others don't.

**Questions to ask when deconstructing (from Julie Zhuo's "How to Do a Product Critique"):**
- What's the experience of getting started or signing up?
- How does this app explain itself in the first minute?
- How easy to use was the app?
- How did you feel while exploring the app?
- Did the app deliver on your expectations?

**Go deeper with comparisons:** To better understand a product, compare it with others in the same category. For example, comparing Cash App with Venmo reveals fundamentally different approaches:
- **Venmo** leans into its social graph (use it because your friends are on it)
- **Cash App** focuses on ease of use and breadth of capabilities (run personal finances or small business from your phone)

**Observe your own reactions:** Note moments of frustration and delight.

**Frustration example:** Trying to log in to a medical app but unable to remember password. The password reset flow never sent an email, even after multiple attempts, so you just stopped using the service.

**Delight example:** Carta's stock-vesting email includes an animation with confetti that takes the celebration feeling to another level. Google Photos collages combine multiple photos of the people who matter most in delightful ways.

**Bonus practice:** Meditation can improve empathy and observation skills by helping you become more perceptive—not just of other people's feelings but also of your own.

### 3. Learn from Great Product Thinkers

One of the biggest levers for developing creativity (and product sense) is to spend time with people who already have it.

**If you work at a company with great product thinkers:**
- Attend as many product reviews as you can
- Take copious notes during reviews
- Look for patterns in the questions and feedback you hear—what type of comments keep coming up
- Over time, you'll understand the mental checklists product leaders use and identify the principles they use to make decisions and trade-offs

**Example: Stewart Butterfield's approach at Slack**

One lesson from Stewart: **"The details are not the details. They make the design."** His obsession with details is one of the main reasons Slack exists and is used by millions.

For example, if a user tries to use @channel to message a large number of teammates across multiple time zones in Slack, they'll see a cartoon rooster asking them to think twice. It's a detail that wasn't built to move metrics but rather to prevent anxiety for people who would otherwise receive work notifications at odd hours. The rooster icon was chosen to keep the tone playful so the message sender doesn't feel ashamed.

Another lesson: **Spend time understanding user problems and framing them in a way that sets strong constraints.** Many PMs jump into solution-finding before they truly understand the problem. If you understand why a problem exists and frame it clearly, you'll identify enough constraints that only a few solutions will be left, streamlining decision-making.

**If you don't work at such a company:**
- Look for external mentors
- Read articles or interviews from people like Julie Zhuo, Stewart Butterfield, David Lieb, and Rahul Vohra
- Watch videos where product leaders share their thought processes

**Questions to ask great product thinkers:**
- What prompted you to build your product? (Gives sense of user insights to look for)
- What were the key decision points along the way?
- What alternative approaches did you consider? (Understanding discarded solutions helps you see how they test hypotheses and make trade-offs)
- What were surprising insights or results? (Knowing when initial hypotheses were wrong helps uncover great insights)
- What principles or frameworks helped you navigate the ambiguity? (Great product thinkers internalize principles you can use to guide your decisions)

### 4. Be Curious About Changes in Technology and Your Domain

Another practice for developing creativity is to spend time learning about emerging trends in technology, society, and regulations. Changes in the industry create opportunities for launching new products that can address user needs in new ways.

**Examples:**
- **Cash App** decided to support Bitcoin transactions, and 76% (nearly $4.6 billion) of its 2020 revenues came from Bitcoin
- **Uber** became possible because of the proliferation of smartphones with GPS capabilities and the availability of Google Maps APIs
- **Clubhouse** took off quickly because of the pandemic, which accelerated the need for virtual public discourse

**Two levels to track:**

**Macro trends:** Important platform shifts (e.g., web3, AR/VR, AI), social shifts (e.g., the shift to remote work), and changes in regulations (e.g., new privacy protection laws).

Keep an open mind about new technologies—at first they receive a lot of skepticism and have obvious flaws. When you see a new trend, instead of dismissing it as a fad, ask yourself: "If this trend reaches its full potential, what opportunities will it create that I can pursue?"

**How to keep up with macro trends:**
- Watch annual developer conferences from major tech companies (Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon)
- Read commentary from industry analysts (e.g., Ben Thompson)
- Follow tech founders and investors on Twitter (e.g., Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Balaji Srinivasan)
- Invest in or advise startups operating in spaces that interest you, or pay attention to what companies top VCs are investing in

**Micro changes:** Many non-obvious opportunities lie in deeply understanding micro changes that may unlock new possibilities. For example, Figma's high-quality browser-based application for designers became possible only once WebGL became performant enough.

To understand micro changes, meet with engineers and domain experts and go deep with them on topics of interest, such as new APIs or platform capabilities.

**As Paul Graham said:** "Live in the future, then build what's missing." Living in the future is also an effective approach to developing your product sense.

## How to Tell If You're Getting Better

Developing product sense takes time and practice. As you get better at it, you'll:

- Notice subtle things about products and people that you would have missed before (e.g., micro frustrations and delights)
- Anticipate non-obvious user problems when you look at product experiences or before you present at product reviews
- Develop higher-quality hypotheses about product experiences to build, even in the face of ambiguity
- Contribute more unique insights to your team, given your improved understanding of users and the landscape
- Be right more often than not about what impact a change to a flow has on metrics
- Potentially receive comments from your design partner on how impressed they are with a detail you noticed

**Additional practice:** Actively reflect on the product sense loop:
1. Identify all product and user assumptions
2. Construct experiments and approaches to prove/disprove them
3. Deeply analyze outcomes, and reflect on why you were right or wrong
4. Repeat

If your product assumptions get proven more and more frequently (e.g., when you started, you were right 2/10 times and now you're right 8/10 times), you know your product sense is improving.
