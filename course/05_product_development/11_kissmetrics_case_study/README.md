# Module: KISSmetrics Case Study

"How we lost a billion-dollar opportunity by losing focus, dropping random ideas, and forgetting the process that made us successful."

It's a detailed case study in how even with the right product-market fit, you can still lose everything by failing to maintain focus, process, and execution speed.
