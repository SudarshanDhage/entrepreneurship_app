# The Burnt Pizza Problem

"You need to determine whether the pizza is burnt (e.g. did you execute poorly) or if the pizza was a bad idea."

That's Dan Robinson's framework. And it's one of the most important skills for early-stage startups.

**The default state for early stage startups is to have low, inconsistent usage.** One of the most important jobs of anyone at a startup? Diagnose low usage and identify strategies for increasing it.

**The Burnt Pizza paradigm:** Let's say you're experimenting with a new food. You give test users burnt pizza. They don't like it. Was pizza a bad idea? Or was the problem that it was burnt?

Whenever Heap shipped a feature that got weak usage, the right question was: **"Were we wrong about the user need, or did we do a bad job solving it?"**

**Here's what's interesting:** Often many of the best companies have ideas that are very similar to a myriad of other competitors.

Facebook, Myspace, and Friendster famously had very similar ideas. But Facebook grew into a generational company by focusing on **execution of viral features and moving very quickly.** They didn't "burn the pizza." They focused on listening to their users.

**The lesson:** Before you pivot or abandon an idea, diagnose the problem. Is it the idea? Or is it the execution?

Many "failed" products were just poorly executed versions of good ideas.
