# Nine Rules from Monetizing Innovation

A concise summary of the nine essential rules for successfully monetizing innovation, based on the book "Monetizing Innovation" by Madhavan Ramanujam and George Tacke.

## The Nine Rules

### 1. Have the "Willingness to Pay" Talk Early

Have the "willingness to pay" talk with customers **early in the product development process** to ensure you're building something customers will pay for.

By doing it early you can prioritize features appropriately. The key is to determine what the customer values and is willing to pay for.

**Pricing is key to product market fit.**

### 2. Don't Force a One-Size-Fits-All Solution

Don't force a one-size-fits-all solution. Build segments based on differences in your customers' willingness to pay for a new product.

This is also true for messaging: demos, presentations, and proposals should be tailored to different segments.

### 3. Product Configuration and Bundling Is More Science Than Art

Product configuration and bundling is more science than art. Here a **jobs-to-be-done approach** is much more useful than demographics for B2B offerings.

Focus on what job the customer needs your product to do, not just who they are demographically.

### 4. Choose the Right Pricing and Revenue Model

Choose the right pricing and revenue model. **How you charge is often more important than how much you charge.**

Linking this to how the customer realizes value from the offering is essential. Especially if you absorb much of the adoption risk for new prospects so that they only pay for the value they experience.

### 5. Develop Your Pricing Strategy

Develop your pricing strategy. **Look a few steps ahead** to maximize gains in the short and long term.

The realities for a startup is that early customers may require a discount or pricing model that reflects the considerable risks of your offering not delivering value. Manage the transition once you have strong product-market fit and can command better pricing.

### 6. Draft Your Business Case Using Customer Willingness-to-Pay Data

Draft your business case using customer willingness-to-pay data, and establish links between price, value, volume, and cost.

**The basis for your product price has to be the value it creates in your customer's business.**

### 7. Communicate the Value Clearly and Compellingly

Communicate the value of your offering clearly and compellingly; otherwise you will not get customers to pay full measure.

**Less is more:** If the top two or three features or outcomes from using your product are not convincing, the next six probably won't help.

You can tailor your message to the job that your customer needs your product to do for them: it's a good idea to do some discovery or targeting before launching into your demo or presentation.

### 8. Understand Your Customers' Irrational Sides

Understand your customers' irrational sides, because whether you sell to other businesses or to consumers, **your customers are people.**

For B2B, this means understanding the culture and language of an industry so that you can pass the "shibboleth test." Your conversations with prospects about issues and alternatives should be in the language of the prospect.

### 9. Maintain Your Pricing Integrity

Maintain your pricing integrity. **Control discounting tightly.**

If demand for your new product is below expectations, only use price cuts as a last resort, after all other measures have been exhausted.

## Key Takeaways

- **Pricing is key to product-market fit** - It's not something to figure out after you've built the product
- **Early customer conversations about WTP** help prioritize features and ensure you're building something people will pay for
- **Segmentation matters** - Not just for pricing, but for messaging and product configuration
- **How you charge matters as much as how much you charge** - The pricing model itself can be a competitive advantage
- **Value-based pricing** - Base price on the value created for the customer, not just your costs
- **Communication is critical** - Focus on 2-3 compelling features/outcomes rather than overwhelming with details
- **Understand context** - Whether it's irrational behavior or industry language, understand your customers deeply
- **Pricing discipline** - Control discounts and only cut price as a last resort
