# Monthly vs. Annual Subscription Model: What Is Best for Your Business?

The subscription model isn't going anywhere. In fact, it has proven to be a predominant force in the software market with an increasing number of success stories.

There are the heavy hitters like Zoom, Adobe, and Salesforce. Then there are the more emerging services such as Fair—which offers medium-term car subscriptions—and BetterCloud—an operations management platform that monitors and secures data for SaaS applications.

The reason the subscription business model is so popular? **It can be a dynamic growth tool.**

Whether your SaaS or subscription-based business is operating on a monthly or annual subscription model—or even a combination of the two—you may be wondering which is truly best for your business and its future success.

## 5 Benefits of a Monthly Subscription Model

From start-ups to established SaaS businesses, when it comes to the subscription industry, many offer the monthly subscription model exclusively for a variety of reasons.

### 1. Simplicity and Flexibility

First off, from a business perspective—as well as for the customer—**the monthly model is simple and flexible.** You charge your customers a fee each month for the services you provide. As your business and its offerings evolve, customers can easily evolve their subscriptions accordingly, and likely without having to involve your sales team in negotiations.

### 2. Faster Growth

Another benefit of this model is that a monthly subscription option **reduces the commitment new customers face** in order to get started using your SaaS. The resulting reduction in sales friction can ultimately make it quicker and easier to build up your customer base. Your business can also save time and money on the efforts of your sales team, as pitching a yearly service often involves a much longer sales cycle.

However, this reduced customer commitment can also be a disadvantage. Businesses that use the monthly model often have a higher churn rate as customers can easily move on after a few months of test-driving your service.

**SaaS contracts of less than a year in length have a churn rate of nearly 17%, compared to 15% for annual contracts.**

### 3. More Lucrative

Monthly subscriptions tend to have a **higher per-month cost than their annual counterparts.** This is to account for the fact that a month-to-month subscription could allow your customers more opportunity to churn: once per month, rather than once per year.

Ultimately, assuming you have good customer retention numbers, **this means more cash in your pocket over time.**

### 4. Reduced Barrier to Entry for Customers

From your customers' perspective, **the cost of your services appears much friendlier when they're paying monthly rather than yearly.** Instant access at a minimal investment can effectively navigate the price pain point for even the smallest customer.

### 5. Investor Appeal

Finally, the **quick customer-base growth** the monthly subscription model can facilitate looks very appealing from an investor perspective. After all, 10,000 customers on the books always appear better than 1,000 customers. Plus, the recurring revenue increases business valuations.

However, keep in mind the increased churn rate the monthly model can encourage creates a **more unpredictable flow of revenue**, which is the opposite of what investors like to see. Losing customers is never fun, and quick turnovers can create extra stress on your business as you may not have even yet covered the cost of acquisition.

To counter this, businesses offering monthly subscriptions need to put a concerted effort into nurturing and maintaining their customers. This likely means building out dedicated customer success teams to prevent churn.

## 5 Benefits of an Annual Subscription Model

In contrast to the monthly model, the annual subscription involves a yearly fee for services, and, often, an annual contract.

### 1. Increased Investment Capital

The annual model can be a popular option because it **provides your business with an entire year's worth of revenue up front**, allowing for reinvestment into growth and development. Customers may also commit to a year's worth of service but pay monthly to break up the cost.

### 2. Higher Customer Retention

Either way, the annual subscription model is beneficial from a business perspective because it **ensures you'll retain your customers for at least a year.** This gives your SaaS business ample time to demonstrate the real benefits of your product.

The larger commitment of this model often means customers have put more time into making their purchase decision. As a result, they're typically invested in getting the most out of their purchase.

### 3. More Opportunities to Encourage Customer Loyalty

A downside to the annual model is it also often involves a **lengthier sales cycle**, which means a higher customer acquisition cost (CAC). This likely means it will take longer to build up your customer base. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

By investing time in acquiring annual subscribers, your business has the opportunity to **build a more loyal, committed customer base.** This ultimately means increased cash flow, improved customer retention, and reduced churn—all important contributors to future success.

### 4. Increased Convenience and Customer Savings

From a customer perspective, the biggest benefit of the annual model is **they'll only have to go through the procurement process once a year.** It can be a huge burden to make a large purchase decision on behalf of one's employer, so reducing this burden can certainly appeal to some customers.

Normally, customers also **save money by signing up for a prepaid annual contract**—a positive for any budget.

### 5. Revenue Predictability

From an investor perspective, there's nothing more appealing than **stable, predictable revenue.** As mentioned, this model is ideal in this regard. Upfront payments make it much easier to provide a full picture of the financial status of a business, which makes it easier for investors to buy in.

This can also make it easier for businesses to have a **clear understanding of their own cash flow situation**, which is obviously important information when it comes to decision-making and future planning.

On the other hand, the higher cost and commitment up front means annual billing can sometimes dissuade potential customers from signing on. Large, infrequent lump payments can also lead to clients mistakenly disputing bills, or refusing to renew contracts.

## How Your Subscription Model Impacts Revenue Recognition

At any given time—regardless of the model it's using—a subscription business must be able to see how much revenue it has collected from its customers. The business also needs to know how much of that revenue is deferred because the service has not yet been fully delivered, and how much has been fully recognized.

### Why Revenue Recognition Matters

**From a business perspective:** Accurate revenue recognition affords reliable business intelligence. If your business has an accurate account of its cash flow and recognized revenue, it can make better decisions with regard to its growth and development.

Properly tracked deferred revenue also ensures properly calculated corporate taxes. This gives a business a clear picture of how much deferred revenue it will carry into future periods.

**From a compliance viewpoint:** Businesses need to be able to properly recognize their revenue to comply with the **ASC 606 standard**.

**For customers:** Accurately recognizing revenue makes it simple for businesses to determine how much customers should be reimbursed in the case of plan adjustments and cancellations. Most monthly models aren't reimbursed.

**For investors:** Revenue recognition shows transparency. Deferred revenue is a liability rather than an asset, so having full and accurate visibility into your business's financial situation can make investors feel more secure in their decision to get involved.

And if your business has a goal of going public, ensuring your revenue recognition is up to snuff is a must. You must be able to show financial statements that properly track your deferred and recognized revenue.

## Key Considerations

### The Monthly Model

**Best for:**
- Startups looking for rapid customer acquisition
- Products with low commitment barriers
- Businesses targeting price-sensitive customers
- Companies with strong customer success teams

**Watch out for:**
- Higher churn rates (17% vs 15% for annual)
- Less predictable revenue
- Need for dedicated retention efforts
- Higher per-month pricing to account for churn risk

### The Annual Model

**Best for:**
- Established businesses seeking predictable revenue
- Products with proven value propositions
- Companies targeting enterprise customers
- Businesses with longer sales cycles

**Watch out for:**
- Longer sales cycles and higher CAC
- Potential customer resistance to upfront costs
- Need to demonstrate value over full year
- Risk of large, disputed payments

### The Hybrid Approach

Many successful businesses offer **both monthly and annual options**, allowing customers to choose based on their needs:

- **Monthly** for customers who want flexibility or can't commit upfront
- **Annual** for customers who value savings and convenience
- **Annual paid monthly** as a middle ground—commitment with payment flexibility

This approach maximizes your addressable market by catering to different customer preferences and budgets.

## Summary

There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The right subscription model depends on:

- Your target market and customer preferences
- Your stage of growth
- Your ability to retain customers
- Your need for predictable revenue
- Your sales and customer success capabilities

**Many businesses find success with a combination of both models**, offering customers the flexibility to choose what works best for them while maximizing revenue potential and customer satisfaction.

Regardless of which model you choose, **proper revenue recognition and accounting compliance are essential** to avoid financial risks and ensure accurate business intelligence.
