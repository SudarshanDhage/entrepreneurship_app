# Startup Pricing 101

"Pricing gives the most bang for your buck. You should work on pricing. If you've never touched the pricing of your product, then you're losing out on lots of potential growth."

## Why Pricing Matters Most

There are three levers you can pull to improve growth: acquisition, retention, and monetization.

According to a survey of over 500 SaaS companies:

- **Acquisition:** Increase efforts by 1% → get a 3.32% return
- **Retention:** Increase efforts by 1% → get a 6.7% return  
- **Monetization (Pricing):** Increase efforts by 1% → get the biggest return

Yet pricing is the most neglected lever. Why? Because people are scared that if they get pricing wrong, they'll lose all their customers.

## First Principles: The Pricing Thermometer

To understand pricing, you need to understand three factors and the relationships between them: **cost**, **price**, and **value**.

### The Three Factors

**Cost → Price → Value**

- **The gap between price and cost** = your **margin** = **incentive to sell**
  - The bigger this gap, the more driven you are to push your product, hire better salespeople, etc.

- **The gap between price and value** = **incentive to buy**
  - The larger this gap, the easier it is to get customers to sign up or use your product

### Two Ways to Set Price

1. **Cost-plus pricing:** Start with your cost, add a margin, that's your price
   - If you know your costs, figure out price based on that

2. **Value-based pricing:** Start with the value your product provides, price is derived from that
   - Figure out what the value is, then set your price from that

**In startups, you should almost always strive for value-based pricing.** It allows you to charge much more and manipulate the "incentive to buy."

## The Four Pricing Mistakes Startups Make

Because people don't understand the relationships between cost, price, and value, they put their price in an arbitrary place and don't know what forces drive it. This results in four common mistakes:

### 1. Pricing Too Low

**The #1 piece of advice we give to most startups is: you're consistently undercharging.**

Most companies fall into this trap because:
- You underestimate your costs → margins aren't enough to cover acquisition
- You don't understand your value → can't convince customers of the value you offer
- You don't understand how customers value your product

### 2. They Don't Understand Your Value

You don't know how your company thinks about the problem you're solving, or how they value it. Either they don't understand your value, or you don't know how to convince them of the value you think you offer.

### 3. You Don't Know How to Convince Them of Value

Even if you understand the value, you can't communicate it effectively.

### 4. Focusing on the Wrong Customers

The trap: "If I build a better product and charge half of the competition, I win."

**That almost never happens.** As a startup working on innovative products in new markets, you're focused on the wrong customers. They are not the mainstream people who are going to look at the price and make most of the determination based off of that.

## Why Pricing Is Hard for Startups: The Product Lifecycle

This is the sales and profit over a product's life from inception to demise. There are five different stages:

1. **Product Development** - You're here
2. **Introduction** - You're here
3. **Growth**
4. **Maturity**
5. **Decline**

**You who are in startup school, you who are getting seed funding, you are in the first two stages, product development and introduction. You are not in the growth phase.**

The customers in the first two stages don't look like mainstream customers that you find in growth and maturity stages. They're not mature customers. They're **early adopters**.

### The Early Adopter Insight

You don't really get a lot of momentum and growth until you get past the first **2% to 5% of potential buyers** of your market. These people in that 2% to 5% are called **early adopters**, and the thing that drives them is very different from mainstream people.

### What Drives Early Adopters

When you're building an innovative product, you're requiring users to change their pattern—to stop doing it the old, shitty, spreadsheet way and do it in the new, better, your way.

Getting someone to change their pattern is difficult, especially if they're a mature person, partly because:
- The average user lacks information needed to make that change
- They lack trust in you or whatever it is that you're making
- They're not comfortable taking risks

**You are entrepreneurs. You're comfortable taking risks. Your customers are not entrepreneurs for the most part. They're probably less comfortable taking risks.**

So in the beginning, you're going after people who are willing to take a risk, and those are **early adopters**. Those are people who:

- **Care about benefits above all else**
- The highest value to them is beating their competition
- They want to do something much better
- They're willing to take a chance that something new will give them that edge over anybody else

**Those early adopters, therefore, are not price-sensitive.**

If anything, if you've built a better product and you charge less, it looks like you have reputation risk. It's like, "Why is it too good to be true? What is the catch?" And what will end up happening is it takes much longer to get them to understand.

## How to Do Price Optimization

Price optimization is about finding the perfect balance between how much you charge and how much sales volume you get.

You don't need complicated demand-yield curves. Just use a simple table:

| Price | Conversion Rate | Sales Volume | Revenue |
|-------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| $X    | Y%             | Z units      | $A      |
| ...   | ...            | ...          | ...     |

Try different prices and see what the effect is. You want to have a column that says:
- These are the prices I'm gonna try
- What is the result in conversion rate?
- What is the result in sales volume?
- How much revenue did I generate?

That's all it is. You should immediately be able to see who the winner is.

### Lost Opportunities

Once you've figured out the optimal price on a simple product, remember that the areas at lower prices—if you can afford them in terms of your margin—are actually **lost opportunities**.

These are what you're going to see if you offer discount pricing or offer tiered pricing at different price points.

## The Danger Zone: Are You in Trouble?

A useful exercise: Calculate what your business would look like to be a billion-dollar company.

The rule of thumb: To be a billion-dollar company, you need to be doing **$100 million a year in revenue**.

At your price point, **how many customers do you need to have to make $100 million in that year?**

Different price points show different customer requirements:

- **$100 price point** with a potential of a million users = **consumers**
- **$1,000 a year** = **enterprise**

The area in between—**the SMB space**—is the part that a lot of companies are in and really, really struggle. They're on the struggle bus. These are people who kind of treat their money like consumers, right, but they kind of look like they might be an enterprise.

**This is the danger zone.**

## How Price Determines Your Acquisition Strategy

Your price completely determines what you can do and what you cannot do in terms of customer acquisition.

Imagine a graph where:
- **Vertical axis:** Price (low to high)
- **Horizontal axis:** Complexity of your sales process (low to high)

### Self-Serve ($2,000 or less, low complexity)

If you have a product that is $2,000 or less and is basically self-serve:

- **Marketing:** Almost all marketing must be inbound. You can't spend a lot of money outbound or on ads.
- **Support:** Completely self-serve or very, very minimal.
- **Sales:** No sales team at this price point. You can't afford it.
- **Conversions:** Can happen on the same day, must be in a self-serve model.

### Transactional ($2,000 to $10,000)

When you're able to charge this, you're able to have a few new toys:

- **Marketing:** Can be focused on generating qualified leads.
- **Support:** Can offer SLAs, or you could start paying for training to help people get onboarded.
- **Sales:** 
  - Can't hire a dedicated salesperson, but maybe you can have an inside sales rep
  - Could maybe have an SDR
  - Could maybe have someone dedicated to giving product demos
- **Sales cycle:** Should not be longer than one to three months.

### Enterprise ($25,000+)

- **Marketing:** Can start spending on branding, building up trust with customers.
- **Support:** Very, very high-touch. Can afford phone support, customer success person dedicated to the client.
- **Sales:** 
  - Start thinking about sales managers
  - Dividing stuff into territories
  - Having sales engineers that participate in conversion and sales calls
- **Sales cycle:** About six to 12 months.

### The Garbage Zone

If it's taking you months and months and months to close someone but you're not making a lot of money to cover it, you have a process where your acquisition costs are just too high for you to be sustainable.

**If you're in the garbage zone, you have to get yourself out of that problem. All of your work should be towards increasing the perceived value of your product or service.**

## The 10/5/20 Rule

A simple rule of thumb for pricing optimization:

### 1. 10X Value Rule

The value should be **10X the price** of whatever you're charging, and it should be **easily understood** to be 10X.

For example, if you charge $10, then it should be in terms of perceived value by your customer that it's worth $100 to them.

**If they do not immediately understand the 10X value of the price, it's gonna be hard to get them to move. Their incentive to buy might be too low.**

### 2. Start Raising Prices by 5%

Once you have any kind of price—and this is particularly important for people who are doing B2B or enterprise sales—you should start practicing raising prices.

Start by raising prices by **5%**. If you feel really confident, jump it up by bigger numbers if you want, but this is a pretty safe way to do it so that you can feel comfortable with it.

### 3. Keep Raising Until You Lose 20% of Deals

Keep raising prices until you're losing **20% of your customers**. That's about a good balance to have in terms of understanding that you have a good price here.

You're losing 20% of your deals. It's not too high. It's not too low.

## Summary: Pricing Fundamentals

**Pricing gives the most bang for your buck. You should work on pricing.** If you've never touched the pricing of your product, then you're losing out on lots of potential growth.

### Understand the Variables

- Do you really understand your costs?
- Do you understand why you've played the price where it is?
- Do you understand the value?

When you go into a sales meeting or a call, do you talk to people and basically say: **"I know exactly what this is going to be worth to you. So when I tell you what the price is going to be, you're going to be like, 'Damn, that's totally worth it.'"**

### Go After Early Adopters

Remember, as a startup, that is who you're going after. So when you are talking to customers and they are taking a really long time to make a decision, or they're wanting to have a lot more proof that other people are using it, **you are not talking to an early adopter. You're wasting a lot of time on non-believers.**

Go after early adopters first. Don't take it personally when these people who are much more mature aren't ready for your product. They were never going to be.

**Your job is to get through that first 2% to 5% of the market.** Those early adopters care more about benefits than price. So don't undercharge your products when you have something that is of value and easily understood to have value.

### Get Organized

When you're doing price optimization, it's really, really easy. Don't overcomplicate things:

1. Figure out a bunch of different price points you wanna check
2. Understand sales volume, conversion rate, and the revenue that's involved
3. That will help you make the best pricing decision

### Your Price Determines Your Acquisition Strategy

If you realize that your sales cycle or all the things that you're spending on is way too much for the amount of money that you're charging, **you either need to increase the price or completely reduce your acquisition strategy costs.**

### Use the 10/5/20 Rule

- Set a price that is **10X**, that is a **10th of the value**
- Increase prices by **5%** until you're losing **20% of the deals**

**Thank you very much, guys.**
