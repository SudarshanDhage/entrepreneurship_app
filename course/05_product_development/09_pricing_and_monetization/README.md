# Module: Pricing and Monetization

"Pricing gives the most bang for your buck. You should work on pricing. If you've never touched the pricing of your product, then you're losing out on lots of potential growth."

Pricing is one of the most neglected yet highest-impact decisions you'll make as a startup. According to a survey of over 500 SaaS companies, increasing efforts on pricing optimization by just 1% yields a 6.7% return—the highest of any growth lever.

This module covers the fundamentals of pricing: why it's particularly hard for startups, how to optimize it, and how pricing determines your entire acquisition strategy.
