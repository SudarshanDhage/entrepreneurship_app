# The Evernote Story: Ahead of Its Time, Behind the Curve

**"They say that elephants never forget, and Silicon Valley is no different."**

Evernote was and remains one of the best examples of what a freemium product can be. Despite this, Evernote has been plagued by a series of managerial missteps and failed product launches, and the company's future is far from certain.

## The Vision: An Extension of the Human Mind

The idea for Evernote began with the personal quest of its founder, Stepan Pachikov. He aimed to solve a giant problem: overcoming the limitations of human memory.

Pachikov is one of Silicon Valley's most visionary technologists. A pioneer of virtual reality, computerized handwriting analysis, and optical character recognition, Pachikov has spent much of his life working to solve some of computing's most challenging problems.

As a scientist living and working under Communist rule in Soviet Russia, Pachikov was no stranger to the forgotten. He saw firsthand how generations of culture and collective memory were jeopardized by the gradual collapse of Soviet Russia. With few ways to preserve them, even key moments from his own past had been lost to the march of time.

> "Even 30 years ago, I had already lost so much information. Names. Jokes. Phrases. Facts. I can study and re-learn what I have forgotten, but I cannot go back to my school years, my college years, and recollect what I knew. Teachers. Friends. Experiences. In the past 20 years, I have put 75,000 pictures into my photo database. But pictures from before that are lost." — Stepan Pachikov, founder of Evernote

To Pachikov, Evernote wasn't just another app or a way to capitalize on Silicon Valley's burgeoning obsession with personal productivity. It was an extension of the human mind itself that would let users remember everything.

Pachikov worked on the prototype of Evernote (which was initially known as EverNote) for two years, and released a beta version of the tool for Windows in 2004.

## The Partnership: Phil Libin Joins

In 2006, on the other side of the United States in Boston, serial entrepreneur Phil Libin was planning his next move. Like Pachikov, Libin had emigrated from Russia to the United States as a young man. And, like Pachikov, Libin was fascinated by the limitations of human memory.

Libin's third venture, which he called Ribbon, would be an organizational tool that would help people save and access the information they needed, when they needed it.

EverNote and Ribbon were very similar in both form and function. However, Pachikov had made significant headway with EverNote by the time Libin was ready to begin developing his company's own technology. Libin traveled from Boston to Silicon Valley to meet Pachikov and the two men decided to merge their two fledgling companies rather than compete with one another.

> "[Phil Libin] was smart, educated, and I was completely confident that he would be a much better CEO than I was. His Russian is better than my English. I believed he would transform the company and make it successful." — Stepan Pachikov, founder of Evernote

Both Pachikov and Libin were dissatisfied with the limitations of the human mind. However, while both men were idealistic, even philosophic, about their idea, Libin possessed the keen eye for business that Pachikov lacked—a quality that Pachikov believed made Libin an ideal partner.

## The Mobile Bet: Perfect Timing

One of Libin's most significant contributions to the growing company came very early on, when Libin steered Evernote away from Windows towards a bold new frontier—mobile.

The central premise behind Evernote was accessibility. If Evernote was to help people remember everything, then users had to be able to capture everything. That meant mobile. However, in 2006, mobile was far from the dominant platform it is today. Apple's flagship iPhone wouldn't be released for another year, and by Libin's own admission betting big on mobile was exactly that—a gamble.

> "From the start, we made a big promise to our users—we would help them remember everything. In order to live up to that, Evernote would need to be easily accessible from every computer, phone or other device that a person used, for the rest of their lives. So, it wasn't that we predicted the rise of mobile, as much as we felt that mobile would be critical to our success." — Phil Libin, former CEO of Evernote

**That gamble paid off.** When the iPhone launched in 2007, Evernote was ready. The product looked and felt completely different from its earlier incarnation. Evernote's aesthetic was sleek, clean, and stylish, and it felt fantastic to use on mobile.

However, what drove much of Evernote's initial adoption wasn't the aesthetic of its mobile app—it was the emergence of the App Store. Just as smartphone apps were a brand-new way of using software, app marketplaces were brand-new, ready-made distribution channels that offered developers immediate access to millions of potential users. Evernote's engineers worked tirelessly to ensure that Evernote would be available as each new app marketplace launched, each of which expanded Evernote's footprint considerably.

**Timing was crucial.** By Libin's own admission, Evernote's timing was crucial to the company's success. Had Evernote's development schedule been even six months off, it would have missed the huge growth driven by its status as a launch application when the iPhone was released in 2007.

## The Core Product: Brilliant Design

Libin's vision for Evernote was a seamless experience that successfully bridged the gap between the physical and digital worlds. To accomplish this, Evernote treated every piece of information—from actual handwritten notes to saved URLs—as a "note," which are organized into thematic "notebooks."

Evernote's functionality was impressive. Users could save all kinds of information within seconds. Digitized handwritten notes, audio recordings, links, pictures taken on a user's mobile device, saved images, to-do lists, clipped articles—virtually anything users could find online could be saved, archived, and synched across multiple devices.

However, the real brilliance of Evernote was its search functionality, what Libin described as "the electronic version of having something at the tip of your tongue." Users could search for saved items using an amazing range of search criteria, including date, keyword, topic, location, contacts, or any combination of the above. Users could even download add-ons that allowed notes to be searched by the dominant color of an image.

> "Evernote finds the way your mind works and gives you more and more hooks into your memories." — Andrew Sinkov, former VP of Marketing for Evernote

This sense of fun and satisfaction was critical in Libin's view. To Libin, the experience of using Evernote would be its competitive advantage.

## The Freemium Strategy: Long-Term Greedy

Evernote launched as a freemium product. This was vitally important to Libin. He believed that Evernote would become increasingly valuable to users the longer they used the product and the more they captured and stored within it. As such, Libin wanted to make Evernote as sticky as possible—and he did so by making the free version of the product incredibly generous. There were virtually no feature restrictions or other incentives for users to upgrade from free to paid plans. In fact, the only benefit of upgrading to a paid, $5-per-month subscription was additional storage space.

> "I don't need to squeeze money out of you. I'll have the rest of your life to take your money. It's my long-term greedy strategy. Our slogan is, 'We'd rather you stay than pay.'" — Phil Libin, former CEO of Evernote

**Libin's attitudes toward freemium software may have been popular with Evernote's growing userbase, but it was repellent to investors.** One VC after another turned Libin's company down. There were no complaints about the product—far from it—but there just wasn't enough incentive for free users to upgrade to paid plans.

**This highlights an important lesson: Stay true to your convictions even in the face of overwhelming opposition.** Phil Libin was criticized for years for giving so much away in Evernote's freemium product. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Libin was right to be so protective of Evernote's freemium version. Evernote is a classic—if not the classic—freemium product, and Libin was right to insist on maintaining the free version's features as long as he did, because it drove growth and encouraged users to become heavily invested in Evernote as a product.

## The Rescue: A Swedish User

After struggling to secure institutional investment, Evernote entered into an agreement with a European VC that would have seen the company receive $10M in funding. On the morning in October 2008 when the two parties were due to meet to sign the papers, the investor canceled the meeting and pulled the offer of funding. With just three weeks' worth of cash at hand, Libin came to the grim realization that Evernote as a company would not survive.

It was around that time that Libin received an email from a Swedish user who loved Evernote. The user, whose identity remains a secret to this day, told Libin that Evernote had made him happier and more productive. However, the Swedish user didn't want to just tell Libin how much they loved the app—they wanted to invest. Libin admitted that the company was in need of funding, at which point the mysterious Swedish Evernote evangelist offered to front the company $500,000.

Evernote was saved.

> "He was just a computer nerd and entrepreneur. He had some money and fell in love with our product, simple as that. It was just good luck. Had I gone to bed ten minutes earlier, I wouldn't have opened his email right away and probably gone into work and closed the business." — Phil Libin, former CEO of Evernote

Evernote's anonymous benefactor didn't just save the company, they opened the door to the kind of institutional investment Evernote had been chasing. Evernote kicked off a series of funding rounds over the next two years that propelled the company to new heights of growth. The company raised a total of more than $100M in the process.

## Early Success: Profitability and Growth

Libin's company took full advantage of its sudden reversal of fortunes, using much of its new funding to expand its engineering teams. One thing Evernote didn't spend a cent of its newfound fortune on, however, was advertising.

Since launching in private beta in 2008, Evernote's growth had been gradual, steady, and entirely organic. During the closed beta, Evernote was invite-only. However, while many products use invites as a marketing strategy to capitalize on exclusivity of access, Evernote did so out of an abundance of caution. Between the technical overhead of synchronizing native applications across multiple platforms in real time and working with a new type of backend server architecture, Libin's engineers were more concerned with the stability of their systems than manufacturing hype.

> "The fact that you have to sign up and send around invites to get in actually generated some buzz. That was never our intention; we never thought of the closed beta as a marketing exercise. We were frankly terrified that everything would crash all the time." — Phil Libin, former CEO of Evernote

**Evernote's freemium model may have been a dislike for investors, but Libin's instincts about slow-burn, long-term growth had been proven right.** In early 2011, just three years after launching, Evernote became profitable. Evernote had 80 employees, more than 10M users, and annual sales of approximately $16M.

## The Downfall Begins: Failed Product Launches

Evernote began the period from 2011 to 2015 in an incredibly strong position. Evernote was already profitable and had more money in the bank than it knew what to do with. The company was growing steadily, hiring new talent and expanding into new locations. And, most importantly, the product was attracting upward of a million new users every month.

**However, the honeymoon period didn't last.** In an attempt to diversify its revenue streams, the company embarked upon a series of disastrous product launches that confused users and investors alike—all of which took the company farther and farther away from the core vision of its founders.

### Evernote Peek, Food, and Hello

In the summer of 2011, Evernote released the first of three standalone products it would launch over the next six months: Evernote Peek. The first Smart Cover app for Apple's newly released iPad 2, Peek was a simple trivia application that leveraged the responsive wake and sleep function of the iPad's Smart Cover feature. Users could lift part of their iPad's Smart Cover to see a trivia question on-screen. To reveal the answer, all they had to do was lift up the rest of the cover. Users could use either Peek's questions or their own answers as the basis of Notebooks within the main Evernote app, but Peek offered users little real utility besides a momentary distraction.

A few months later in December 2011, Evernote released two more standalone apps for iOS: Evernote Food and Evernote Hello.

Essentially a simplified, specialized version of the main Evernote app, Evernote Food allowed users to record and log their meals in digital notebooks in much the same way the main Evernote app allowed them to capture and store everything else. Users and investors alike were completely baffled by Food. Firstly, the main Evernote app could already do everything Evernote Food could do and more. There was no incentive whatsoever for people to use Food over the main Evernote app.

Evernote Hello was an even stranger app. The purpose of Hello was ostensibly to make it easier for users to remember people. However, what made Hello such a bizarre—and ultimately damaging—product was the fact that everything in Evernote Hello had to be done manually. The app did not support near-field communication (NFC), the communication protocol that powers contactless payment systems such as Apple Pay. Hello didn't even have a rudimentary electronic business card reader. Every field had to be completed by hand.

Although it may not have seemed like it at the time, Evernote Hello aligned strongly with Pachikov's original vision to help users remember everything. Pachikov himself often used forgetting people's names in professional settings as a prime example of how Evernote could be an indispensable part of people's everyday lives. **What Hello got wrong, however, was the execution.** If Hello had shipped with NFC support, it could have potentially opened up Evernote's products to an entirely new market of business users. It had to be effortless to work. As it stood, Evernote Hello was virtually useless and accomplished little besides diluting the Evernote brand.

### Evernote Market: The Breaking Point

Evernote's next major product launch came almost a year later in September 2013. However, this product wasn't another specialized version of the Evernote app, it was an extensive range of physical Evernote-branded products that the company would sell via its new Evernote Market.

**In the space of a few short years, Evernote had achieved profitability, had millions of dollars in the bank, and the company was growing fast. Evernote Market squandered almost all of the company's brand equity for nothing.**

It's hard to understate the damage that the branded products sold through the Evernote Market inflicted on the Evernote brand. It made absolutely no sense. Users didn't want Evernote-branded tablet styluses or Evernote Moleskine notebooks or Evernote backpacks. They wanted an organizational and productivity product that worked.

The fact that the 2013 version of Evernote was widely considered the buggiest, most unstable version the company had released at that point added insult to injury. Rather than fixing the software problems that users actually cared about, Evernote started selling branded backpacks instead.

Evernote Market wasn't just a troubling sign that the company—and Phil Libin himself—had begun to lose its way. It was another major step away from Pachikov's vision of what Evernote could be.

Both Pachikov and Libin shared a desire to create a "100-year company," but Evernote Market did nothing to work toward or advance Pachikov's vision of Evernote as an extension of the human mind. Pachikov's vision was bold, ambitious, and transformative. By comparison, Evernote Market felt like a cheap cash grab.

## The Bugs: A Reputation for Instability

The company's fortunes went from bad to worse in 2014.

Despite its popularity, Evernote had developed a reputation among its growing userbase for being a buggy, unstable product. That changed when Jason Kincaid, a former TechCrunch writer, published a post on his personal blog titled "Evernote, the bug-ridden elephant."

Kincaid had been an Evernote power user for years, having captured almost 7,000 notes since discovering the product. The post was a reluctant but scathing take-down of Evernote's notorious instability, which Kincaid felt compelled to write after experiencing a slew of technical problems including corrupted files, incomplete backups, and a poor response from Evernote's customer support team. The post went viral and garnered so much attention that Libin personally contacted Kincaid to apologize.

> "None of this has been life-shattering, but given how reliant I am on Evernote, it is deeply unnerving—now each note I instinctively leave myself is tinged with anxiety. I'm concerned that as I dig through my Evernote archive, I'll encounter more corrupted audio notes, and, worse, my paranoia is increasingly convinced that there may have been notes that never were saved to the archive at all." — Jason Kincaid

## The Missing Trend: Team Collaboration

A little more than a year later in October 2014, Evernote unveiled its latest product, Work Chat. A simple messaging client, Work Chat was designed to complement Evernote's Business plans.

It was also long overdue. **Team-based collaboration had been an enormous blind spot in Evernote's vision for years.** The company had already missed one major consumer tech trend by ignoring the exodus of products and services migrating to the cloud and insisting on developing Evernote as a native app.

Similarly, Evernote had been designed as an organizational tool for individuals, when virtually every other productivity tool on the market emphasized team-based collaboration. Work Chat was the first small step toward solving this urgent problem.

Unfortunately for Evernote, that ship had sailed.

As a whole, the company had been distracted by chasing the wrong revenue streams. Instead of building a solid team-based product, Evernote built a food app. The company had expanded too quickly in the wrong direction.

Everything besides the main Evernote app was a distraction from the company's core mission to help people remember everything. Products like Slack and Google's G Suite had successfully made the leap from personal product to collaborative product, whereas Evernote had not.

**This highlights another critical lesson: Pay close attention to broader trends even if they don't affect you right now.** Evernote bet big—and won—on mobile. Evernote missed out on an immense opportunity by failing to respond to the ongoing evolution of consumer tech and opting to double-down on Evernote as a product for individuals, not teams. This arguably set the company up to fail later on, as there was no way for Evernote to course-correct in time to fend off emerging competitors that capitalized on the team-based collaboration trend.

## Leadership Change: Chris O'Neill Takes Over

Evernote changed more than just its pricing structure in 2015, it also changed the company's leadership. In July 2015, Libin announced that he would be stepping down as Evernote's CEO and handing the reins to former Google Glass executive, Chris O'Neill, as his successor.

The disastrous launch of Evernote Market, the instability and bugginess of the product, the lack of a clear direction for the company—they had all taken their toll on Evernote as a company, and Libin as Chief Executive in particular. Apparently discouraged by Evernote's failure to capitalize on its earlier success, Libin reportedly showed little interest in the business side of the company. He described himself as "not passionate" in the announcement about O'Neill's appointment, an admission as frank as it was surprising.

## Attempting Recovery: Too Little, Too Late

For Evernote, the period from 2015 until the present day can be summed up in four short words: too little, too late. Evernote's various failed experiments to diversify its products and revenue streams hadn't just wasted millions of dollars—it wasted precious time the company didn't have. Moving away from the core value proposition of the Evernote product had been a huge mistake. The only thing that could save Evernote was returning to the product's roots. For O'Neill, this meant getting back to Pachikov's original vision for Evernote as an extension of the human mind. Unfortunately for the company, it never managed.

One of O'Neill's first tasks as CEO was to get Evernote's house in order. This began with the prompt closure of Evernote Food in August 2015. Around six months later, the company announced it was also closing the Evernote Market.

### Pricing Changes: Alienating Users

Shortly after Engberg's exit, Evernote introduced sweeping changes to the product's pricing. First, serious restrictions were introduced to Evernote's free plans. Free users were limited to synching their Evernote data across just two devices. Second, Evernote raised the price of its Plus and Premium tiers to $34.99 and $69.99 per year respectively, a price increase of roughly 40%.

One of the biggest and most unpopular changes to Evernote, however, wasn't its new pricing. It was the 60MB upload limit applied to Evernote's free plans. For users who relied on Evernote to save images and other media files, however, the new upload cap was brutal.

For Evernote, the restructuring of its freemium product was both long overdue and urgently necessary. For Evernote's users, however, it was a slap in the face. Not only had Evernote crippled its free version, severely limiting its utility to free users, it had also failed to fix many of the bugs that still plagued even paid versions of the product.

To be fair to Evernote, the company had little choice but to increase prices. Years of Evernote's extremely permissible freemium product had spoiled users who had grown accustomed to making use of Evernote for free and had harmed the company's revenue growth. **What the company should have done to monetize the product while aligning with customers would have been to gradually introduce restriction incentives to its free version over time, rather than transitioning from a generous freemium product to a comparatively expensive paid service.**

Pricing changes are some of the most impactful things a company can do. Evernote didn't put enough thought into its pricing over the years, which is why their once loyal userbase wasted little time in criticizing them over the new pricing plan.

### Evernote Spaces: Six Years Too Late

A year or so later, in February 2018, Evernote took another important step forward with the launch of Evernote Spaces, the company's first truly collaborative team-based product.

Spaces' biggest problem wasn't the product itself—it was the fact that Spaces was released about six years too late. Evernote should have developed Spaces back in 2012, rather than wasting time, money, and brand equity with Evernote Market.

By the time Spaces was released, the team-based productivity market was already saturated with far superior products, including Slack for real-time communication, Box and Google Drive for online storage, and G Suite for personal and team-based collaboration. There was simply no need for Evernote Spaces.

Even more ironic was the rationale behind the development of Spaces. In an interview, O'Neill claimed that 70% of Evernote users were using the product in their personal lives and at work. Had Evernote developed Spaces sooner, it could have leveraged the significant overlap between individual and business use-cases to make greater headway into the productivity tools market.

## Where Evernote Could Go From Here

Despite the problems that have besieged the company and product for years, Evernote still has a relatively large user base. Where could Evernote go from here?

### 1. Development of a Truly Collaborative Team-Based Product

The most optimistic step that Evernote might take is to double-down on development of Spaces or another team-based collaborative product. Evernote may have won its big bet on mobile in 2006, but it missed the boat on cloud-based collaboration, which profoundly reshaped the personal and professional productivity spaces. If Evernote hopes to survive and become the 100-year company that Phil Libin always thought Evernote could be, it will need to develop a strong, team-based product that can compete with G Suite and similar tools.

### 2. Committing to Fixing and Improving the Core Evernote Product

Evernote's reputation for bugs and instability is well-deserved. The company neglected critical technical flaws for years, and users took note. Just as Evernote must develop a team-based tool if it hopes to survive, the company will also have to take its legacy technical issues seriously if the company wants to win back the hearts and minds of formerly enthusiastic users.

### 3. Finding a Buyer

Evernote's fall from grace should be a cautionary tale for any aspiring founder or entrepreneur. At this time, one of Evernote's few remaining options is to hope that a buyer will acquire the company. Evernote is nowhere near ready to IPO, and while the company is likely to sell for much less than anyone would like, an acquisition would be an ideal end-game for the beleaguered company.

## Key Lessons

As sad as it is, Evernote's story offers plenty of lessons to entrepreneurs hoping to launch similarly ambitious products.

### 1. Timing Is Everything (Even If It's Accidental)

By Phil Libin's own admission, Evernote's timing was crucial to the company's success. Had Evernote's development schedule been even six months off, it would have missed the huge growth driven by its status as a launch application when the iPhone was released in 2007. Evernote's timing may have been at least partially accidental, but it played an outsized role in the company's growth trajectory.

**Questions to consider:**
- Let's say you have a chance to travel back through time to one year before your product's launch. What, if anything, would you have done differently?
- How could you capitalize upon external trends or developments to drive initial growth, as Evernote did?
- Would timing the release of your product have an impact on initial adoption?
- What's the "tailwind" at your back? Aside from your own hard work, what tailwinds will push your product forward?

### 2. Stay True to Your Convictions (Even in the Face of Overwhelming Opposition)

Phil Libin was criticized for years for giving so much away in Evernote's freemium product. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Libin was right to be so protective of Evernote's freemium version. Evernote is a classic—if not the classic—freemium product, and Libin was right to insist on maintaining the free version's features as long as he did, because it drove growth and encouraged users to become heavily invested in Evernote as a product.

**Questions to consider:**
- Can you recall a time in which you compromised on a product or business decision that you later came to regret? If so, why did you give in?
- Did you or your product gain anything by doing so, and conversely, would you have gained anything if you had resisted that pressure?
- How well does your actual product align with your original vision for the product? Is it true to your vision, or have you lost sight of what your product should be?
- How have you evangelized or advocated for the decisions you've made for your product?

### 3. Pay Close Attention to Broader Trends (Even If They Don't Affect You Right Now)

Evernote bet big—and won—on mobile. Evernote missed out on an immense opportunity by failing to respond to the ongoing evolution of consumer tech and opting to double-down on Evernote as a product for individuals, not teams. This arguably set the company up to fail later on, as there was no way for Evernote to course-correct in time to fend off emerging competitors that capitalized on the team-based collaboration trend.

**Questions to consider:**
- What's the single most important trend in tech facing your product and why?
- Similarly, what broader technological development poses the greatest risk to your product?
- How have you mitigated this threat, and could your product move quickly enough in response?
- How are you innovating on your original vision? Could you go after different segments of your primary market?

### 4. Don't Lose Sight of Your Core Vision

Evernote's various failed experiments to diversify its products and revenue streams hadn't just wasted millions of dollars—it wasted precious time the company didn't have. Moving away from the core value proposition of the Evernote product had been a huge mistake.

Everything besides the main Evernote app was a distraction from the company's core mission to help people remember everything. Evernote lost sight of Pachikov's original vision—an identity crisis from which Evernote never really recovered.

**The core lesson:** Every new product, feature, or initiative should advance your original vision. If it doesn't, question whether you should be doing it at all.

### 5. Fix Bugs Before Building New Features

Rather than fixing the software problems that users actually cared about, Evernote started selling branded backpacks instead. The company developed a reputation for being buggy and unstable, which alienated even its most loyal users.

**The core lesson:** Technical debt and user-facing bugs compound over time. Addressing them should take priority over new feature development or diversification efforts.

## Elephants Never Forget

They say that elephants never forget, and Silicon Valley is no different. Despite its potential and the boldness of vision of the company's founder, Evernote ultimately lost sight of that vision. By the time it realized this, it was too late.

Despite still having a loyal base of hardcore users, Evernote's future is far from certain. Whether the company can dig itself out of its current predicament remains to be seen, but there's little doubt that Evernote will not be remembered kindly.

Evernote serves as a cautionary tale: even with perfect timing, a visionary product, and a successful freemium model, a company can still lose its way if it doesn't stay true to its core vision, pay attention to broader trends, and maintain focus on what users actually need.
