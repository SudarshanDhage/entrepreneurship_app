## It Just Doesn't Matter

- **Key Concepts:** Product design, simplicity, feature prioritization, knowing what to leave out, design philosophy, minimalism
- **Key Insight:** "Because it just doesn't matter" embodies what makes a product great. Figuring out what matters and leaving out the rest. Best designers and programmers aren't the ones with best skills or nimblest fingers, they are the ones that can determine what just doesn't matter - that's where real gains are made. Most time spent is wasted on things that don't matter. Examples from Campfire: 5-minute timestamps vs every line (doesn't matter 95% of time), no bold/italic formatting (CAPS or asterisks work, don't require software/support/learning curve), no total people count in room (names listed, doesn't change behavior). Would these be nice/great/cool? Sure. But do they really matter? Nope. Philosophy: "We are the audience. We build tools for ourselves." Then put them out for others who think like us. Design for 90% of the time, don't care about other 10%. Solve most common use cases, leave complex ones to others. Key insight: "A good product is not perfect if you cannot add any more - it is perfect if you can't take anything more out of it." Cut out work and thinking that doesn't matter to achieve productivity you've never imagined.
