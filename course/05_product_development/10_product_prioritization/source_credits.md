- **Key Concepts:** Product prioritization, RICE framework, roadmap planning, product management, reach, impact, confidence, effort, scoring systems
- **Key Insight:** RICE is a scoring framework for prioritizing product work that combines four factors: Reach (how many people will this impact per time period), Impact (how much will this impact each person - 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal), Confidence (how confident are you in estimates - 100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low), and Effort (person-months required). Formula: RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort. The resulting score measures "total impact per time worked" - exactly what you want to maximize. Why prioritization is difficult: (1) Satisfying to work on pet ideas you'd use yourself vs projects with broad reach, (2) Tempting to focus on clever ideas vs projects that directly impact goals, (3) Exciting to dive into new ideas vs projects you're confident about, (4) Easy to discount additional effort. Framework helps avoid these biases and consistently compare projects. Key principles: Use real measurements from product metrics for Reach (don't pull numbers from hat), be honest about Confidence (avoid decision paralysis with multiple-choice scale), estimate Effort as person-months (rough estimates with whole numbers or 0.5), Impact uses multiple-choice scale to avoid "tangled mess of gut feeling". After scoring, sort and re-evaluate - reconsider estimates if scores seem wrong, accept gut instinct may be wrong. RICE shouldn't be hard and fast rule - dependencies, table stakes features, or other factors may require working on lower-scored projects first, but framework helps identify when making trade-offs. Framework helps make better-informed decisions and defend them to others. Examples provided for each factor showing how to calculate Reach (450, 2000, 800 customers per quarter), assign Impact scores (3, 1, 2), Confidence scores (100%, 80%, 50%), and Effort scores (2, 4, 1 person-months).

## Prioritization as a Superpower

- **Key Concepts:** Prioritization, leadership, founder traits, VC evaluation, startup success, decision-making, time management, resource allocation
- **Key Insight:** From a VC perspective, prioritization is a fundamental superpower for evaluating founders and CEOs. Especially true in startups where prioritization is everything - many things to do, limited time and resources. Figuring out what to say yes to, what to say no to, timing and sequencing can be the difference-maker between good vs. great vs. exceptional company. Best leaders constantly prioritize by: (1) Sensing right time to tack, change courses, re-prioritize, (2) Communicating with team to ensure everyone understands what and why, especially in times of change, aligned with clarity, (3) Operating with serious urgency when something is at top of list, (4) Delicately balancing near-term vs. long-term priorities, (5) Knowing what needs to be perfect vs. what's fine leaving imperfect to move on, (6) Achieving or exceeding goals. Context on founder traits: Paul Graham lists five (Determination, Flexibility, Imagination, Naughtiness, Friendship), Entrepreneur First lists four (Smart, Skilled, Insightful, Committed), Footwork looks for three (Hungry and humble, Know business inside and out, Magnets for talent). But most successful leaders are outliers who break rules, so prioritization ability cuts through the noise. Key question: "What are you doing to hone it, today?"

## Don't Trust Agile Alone

- **Author:** Anders Toxboe
- **URL:** https://ui-patterns.com/blog/dont-trust-agile-alone-to-build-successful-products
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Agile development, Scrum, product discovery, experimentation, search mode vs execution mode, hill chart, backlog management, validation, desirability, viability, feasibility
- **Key Insight:** "We are all doing high-frequency waterfall. Agile won't save us." Teams stuck in Design, Build, Ship without testing if ideas are good. Agile originally about reducing uncertainty and maximizing learning, but today often becomes high-frequency waterfall. Scrum/XP fail to ask "why" - all ceremonies focus on when, how, and what, not why. Cannot eliminate uncertainty by building backlog - creates tunnel vision focusing on what and when without asking why. Need to do more than thinking - thinking about implementation ≠ doing actual work to figure out best solution. Ryan Singer's hill chart: need uphill work (discovery) before downhill execution. Two modes: (1) Execution mode - planning why failure not option, focus on development velocity, efficiency, (2) Search mode - experimentation, failure embraced, focus on learning velocity. Better to get stuck with 1-2 person experimentation team than 10-person development team. In search mode, validate three areas through experimentation: (1) Desirable - target segment has problem, solution is good fit (comprehension tests, fake door testing, single-feature products, video demo, Wizard of Oz), (2) Viable - desired effect on business (dry wallet, collect pre-orders, sell the future, high hurdle), (3) Feasible - can build it (development spikes, working prototypes, single-feature products, move in with customer). Need to acknowledge discovery work early - significant work searching for right solution, eliminating uncertainty, before executing plan. When confident solution is desired, viable, and feasible, team can trust work will ship and have planned effect.

## Simple Product Management Tricks

- **URL:** https://jacobian.org/2021/oct/20/simple-pm-tricks/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product management, prioritization, effort/impact analysis, timeboxing, estimation, automation, playbooks, planning, backlog management
- **Key Insight:** Three simple, practical product management techniques for non-PMs who need to wear a product hat: (1) Effort/Impact Analysis - technique for long-term planning using 3x3 matrix mapping difficulty (horizontal) against impact (vertical). Fast and loose approach - don't worry about precise definitions. Upper-left (high impact, low effort) = obvious wins. Bottom-right (low impact, high effort) = obvious no's. Pick items from middle based on appetite. Remarkably effective at getting team agreement on work set quickly. Learned from Craig Kerstiens at Heroku. (2) Timebox Hard-to-Estimate Work - for work with huge unknowns (e.g., legacy migrations where unknowns dominate timeline, impossible to know upfront what tasks required). Solution: timeboxing - pick arbitrary length of time (week or two), see how far you get. At end, have more knowledge, review progress, make better-informed decisions. Powerful because approaches estimation differently - instead of "how long will X take?" asks "what can we do in two weeks?". Also useful for projects that can't be completed in reasonable time (e.g., massive bug backlog - untenable to drive to zero, but one day a week might be fine). Great for making progress despite mountains of work or significant unknowns. (3) Write Playbooks Before Automation - automation isn't always slam-dunk we think. We know automation isn't necessarily easy, but process is complex/error-prone/messy. Playbooks as middle ground - instead of doing nothing or diving into code, first write playbook (set of instructions/recipe). Be as specific as possible, include code/shell commands for copy-paste. Gets closer to automation goals (consistency, repeatability, reliability) at fraction of effort. If later decide automation worth it, playbook serves as detailed specification for code.

## Can Do Vs Must Do

- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Prioritization, focus, strategy, execution, resource management, leadership, rule of three, must-do vs can-do, startup management, saying no
- **Key Insight:** The difference between "can do" and "must do" projects, and how companies often confuse the two. With abundance of capital, portfolio companies have resources to do more than they can and should do. They greenlight "can do" projects but not "must do" projects. Problems when confusing the two: (1) Core resources (infrastructure, security, payments, design, product management) get stretched supporting many efforts, (2) Team loses sight of mission and strategy as so many projects tackled simultaneously, (3) Senior leadership gets pulled in many directions and loses alignment, (4) Projects slip or don't ship, leading to malaise and morale issues, (5) Headcount grows quickly to support efforts, creating management issues. Result: Getting stuck in middle, being mediocre, not doing anything well. Customers see it, staff feel it. The Rule of Three: Should not tackle more than three big things at one time, regardless of organization size. Plans shouldn't have more than three things. Test all initiatives against "must do" vs "can do" test. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Strategy is about saying no: Strategy isn't saying no. It's figuring out what is most important for company and deciding to focus on it and say no to everything else. To figure out what's most important, need to understand: products, customers, market position, where things are going, where you want to be in 3-5 years. Once figured out, determine most important things needed to get there. The startup as video game metaphor: Partner Albert thinks doing startup is like playing video game. Each level requires mastering one thing, then level up and new thing to master. Clarifying view on how to think and prioritize. Focus changes as you level up. Diagnosing problem: If frustrated by pace of development, think about how many things trying to do simultaneously. If a lot, run by "can do" vs "must do" test and kill things that aren't "must dos." Might mean parting ways with people you don't need - painful but helpful. What good execution looks like: Executing well on all "must do" things is hallmark of well-run company. Usually means there aren't many "can do" things on roadmap. Can only do few things well, must be most critical. Time is finite, can't keep adding priorities. Each addition requires removing or deprioritizing something else. The people challenge: People who support "can do" instead of "must do" are frequently closest to you. They're encouraging, see possibilities, want to be helpful. But those are people you need to disappoint most acutely. Frameworks for deciding: Alternative lens is resources and reusability. Three questions: (1) How much do we risk if we don't do it? (2) If we do it, will it enrich platform for everyone? (3) What will it take to deliver? The life application: Applies to business or life. To be successful, say no a lot. To be really successful, say no almost all the time. Don't spread yourself too thin. Time is finite. Activity vs Momentum: Two types of organizations - "Activity" organizations (going nowhere) and "Momentum" organizations (know what they must do and do it well). Keeping main thing the main thing: "The main thing is keeping the main thing the main thing" - Stephen Covey. Regular review: What's main thing? Is everything supporting it? Most companies misunderstand differences between strategy, tactics, objectives. Key takeaways: (1) "Can do" is not same as "must do" - just because have resources doesn't mean should, (2) Rule of three - don't tackle more than three big things at once, (3) Strategy is focus - figuring out what's most important and saying no to everything else, (4) Startup is video game - each level requires mastering one thing, (5) Good execution requires focus - executing well on "must dos" is hallmark of well-run company, (6) Time is finite - can only do few things well, (7) Say no to say yes - path to excellence requires saying no to many "can dos" to say yes to "must dos", (8) Cost of confusion - mixing leads to stretched resources, lost alignment, slipped projects, malaise.
