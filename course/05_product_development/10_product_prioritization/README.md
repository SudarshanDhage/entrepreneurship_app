# Module: Product Prioritization

"Prioritization is a perennial challenge when building a product roadmap. How do you decide what to work on first?"

If you've put the effort into brainstorming new ideas, finding opportunities for improvement, and collecting feedback, you'll have a solid product roadmap full of good ideas. But the order in which you tackle those ideas deserves just as much thought. You need to take the time to prioritize well.

This module covers frameworks and methods for prioritizing product work, helping you make better-informed decisions about what to build first and defend those decisions to others.
