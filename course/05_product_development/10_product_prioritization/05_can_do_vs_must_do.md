# Can Do Vs Must Do

The difference between "can do" and "must do" projects, and how companies often confuse the two—leading to stretched resources, lost focus, and poor execution.

## The Core Problem

With the abundance of capital sloshing around the tech sector, portfolio companies often have the resources to do more than they can and should do. They greenlight a bunch of projects that are "can do" projects but not "must do" projects.

**The fundamental issue:** Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

## What Happens When You Confuse "Can Do" with "Must Do"

When companies greenlight too many "can do" projects instead of focusing on "must do" projects, several not so great things happen:

1. **Core resources get stretched:** Infrastructure, security, payments, design, product management—all get stretched supporting so many efforts.

2. **Team loses sight of mission and strategy:** With so many projects being tackled at the same time, the team loses sight of the mission and strategy.

3. **Senior leadership loses alignment:** Senior leadership gets pulled in many directions and loses alignment as a result.

4. **Projects slip or don't ship:** Projects slip or don't ship at all, leading to malaise and morale issues.

5. **Headcount grows quickly:** Headcount grows quickly to support all of these efforts, creating more management issues.

**The result:** Trying to execute on too many things at once results in getting stuck in the middle, being mediocre and not doing anything that well. Customers see it and staff begin to feel it—painful on many fronts.

## The Rule of Three

**The principle:** You should not tackle more than three big things at one time, no matter how large your organization is.

**The reality check:** I saw a presentation recently with a "plan" that had ten "near term focus items" on it. I told the person presenting the plan to me that I don't think a plan should have more than three things on it.

**Applying the test:** Regardless of whether you have two, three, or four big efforts this year, you should test all of your initiatives against the "must do" vs "can do" test.

**The scale question:** The rule of three applies regardless of organization size. For a ~200 person R&D department that identifies 180 projects, those projects should roll up to about three things at the company level. The question isn't how many projects exist—it's how many strategic priorities guide them.

## Strategy Is About Saying No

**What strategy isn't:** Strategy isn't saying no. It is figuring out what is the most important thing for your company and deciding to focus on it and say no to everything else.

**What strategy requires:** In order to figure out what the most important thing is, you need to understand:
- Your products
- Your customers
- Your market position
- Where things are going
- Where you want to be in three to five years

Once you have figured all of that out, you can figure out what are the most important things you need to do in order to get there.

**The challenge:** The "most important thing" changes. Doing a startup is like playing a video game. Each level requires you to master one thing and once you do that, you level up and then there is a new thing to master.

## The Startup as Video Game Metaphor

**The insight:** My partner Albert told me that he thinks doing a startup is like playing a video game. Each level requires you to master one thing and once you do that, you level up and then there is a new thing to master.

**Why it matters:** Even though it trivializes the company building process a bit, it is a very clarifying view on how you must think about things and prioritize things.

**The application:** The focus changes as you level up. What was a "must do" at one stage becomes "can do" at the next. What you couldn't do before becomes essential. The key is recognizing which level you're on and what you need to master now.

## Diagnosing the Problem

**The symptom:** If you are frustrated by the pace of development (and not just engineering development) at your company, think about how many things you are trying to do at the same time.

**The solution:** If it is a lot, then run them by the "can do" vs "must do" test and kill all the things that are not "must dos". That might even mean parting ways with people you don't need, which is painful but often helpful.

**The test:** For each initiative, ask:
- Is this essential to achieving our strategic goals?
- Is this necessary right now, or could it wait?
- Would saying no to this free up resources for something more important?
- Can we do this well, or will it distract from must-dos?

## What Good Execution Looks Like

**The hallmark:** Executing well on all of the "must do" things is the hallmark of a well run company.

**The implication:** That usually means that there aren't many "can do" things on the roadmap at the same time.

**The standard:** You can only do a few things well, and they must be the most critical things. Some startups underestimate the fact that time is finite, and they can't keep adding to their priorities. Each time you add something significant, something else needs to go, or go down in priority.

## The People Challenge

**The reality:** The people who support "can do" instead of "must do" projects are frequently the ones closest to you. They are encouraging, they see all the possibilities for you, and they want to be seen as helpful in your life.

**The hard truth:** But those are the people you need to disappoint most acutely.

**Why it's hard:** It's tempting to say yes to people who are trying to help, especially those you care about. But every "yes" to a "can do" is implicitly a "no" to a "must do."

## Frameworks for Deciding: Resources and Reusability

**An alternative lens:** Instead of framing purely in terms of strategy, also consider resources and reusability.

**The three questions:** For example, if a big client asks for some functionality you don't have, ask (in order):
1. How much do we risk if we don't do it?
2. If we do do it, will it enrich the platform for everyone?
3. What will it take to deliver?

**When it's worth it:** If something you "can do" also enriches the platform for everyone or addresses a strategic risk, it might actually be a "must do."

## The Life Application

**Beyond business:** This applies to business or life, in general. To be successful, say no a lot. If you want to be really really successful, say no almost all the time.

**The principle:** Don't spread yourself too thin. Time is finite. You can only do a few things well, and they must be the most critical things.

**The trap:** We often think we can do more than we actually can. We see possibilities everywhere. But the path to excellence requires focus.

## The Activity vs. Momentum Test

**Two types of organizations:** There are "Activity" organizations and "Momentum" organizations.

**Activity organizations:** Some of them are going nowhere fast and some of them are going nowhere like snails. But, in the end, the place they are headed is nowhere.

**Momentum organizations:** They know what they must do and they do it well. Everything else can wait.

**The question:** When interviewing a potential new client or evaluating your own organization, ask: Are they an "Activity or Momentum" organization?

## Keeping the Main Thing the Main Thing

**The principle:** "The main thing is keeping the main thing the main thing." — Stephen Covey

**The challenge:** It's easy to lose sight of the main thing when you have many "can do" projects competing for attention.

**The practice:** Regular review: What's the main thing right now? Is everything we're doing supporting it, or are we getting distracted?

**The discipline:** Most of what companies are doing is misunderstanding the differences amongst strategy, tactics, and objectives. They think objectives are strategic. They are not.

## Key Takeaways

1. **"Can do" is not the same as "must do":** Just because you have resources to do something doesn't mean you should.

2. **The rule of three:** Don't tackle more than three big things at one time, regardless of organization size.

3. **Strategy is focus:** Strategy is figuring out what's most important and saying no to everything else.

4. **The startup is a video game:** Each level requires mastering one thing before leveling up to the next challenge.

5. **Good execution requires focus:** Executing well on "must dos" is the hallmark of a well-run company.

6. **Time is finite:** You can only do a few things well. Each addition requires removing or deprioritizing something else.

7. **Say no to say yes:** The path to excellence requires saying no to many "can dos" so you can say yes to the "must dos."

8. **The cost of confusion:** Mixing "can do" and "must do" leads to stretched resources, lost alignment, slipped projects, and organizational malaise.
