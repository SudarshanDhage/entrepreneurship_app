# Prioritization as a Superpower

"The ability to prioritize well is a trait of the best leaders."

As a venture capitalist, I find myself constantly evaluating founders and CEOs on their superpowers and blind spots. Whether for a new potential investment, or when working with a portfolio company, it's critical to understand the key reasons a leader may be successful in their role, and also the areas where they may need support.

## What Makes a Great Founder?

A lot has been written about what it takes to be a great founder, or what qualities VCs look for in founders:

- **Paul Graham** lists five traits: Determination, Flexibility, Imagination, Naughtiness, and Friendship
- **Entrepreneur First** lists four qualities: Smart, Skilled, Insightful, and Committed
- **Footwork** looks for three core elements:
  1. **Hungry and humble** - Driven, gritty, resilient, relentless, and also self-aware and intellectually honest
  2. **Know their business inside and out** - Deep understanding of product and business model, unique insights on market and opportunity, can answer questions with brevity and rigor
  3. **Magnets for talent** - Ability to recruit dream people from the early days

What is hard, however, about the exercise of documenting what to look for in founders, or what it takes to be successful, is that, by definition, the most successful leaders and companies are **outliers**. They break all the rules. They don't fit a bunch of patterns.

## The Fundamental Superpower: Prioritization

So to cut through the noise when I'm evaluating a founding team at its core, there's a fundamental superpower I try to unpack: **how well do they prioritize?**

**Especially true in a startup, prioritization is everything.** There are many things to do, with limited time and resources to do them. Figuring out what to say yes to, what to say no to, the timing and sequencing of jobs to be done, and then actually doing them, can be the difference-maker between ultimately building a good company vs. a great company vs. an exceptional company.

## What Prioritization Means to the Best Leaders

The best leaders I've watched in action are seeing around corners to constantly prioritize. To them, prioritization means:

1. **Sensing the right time to tack, change courses, and re-prioritize** - Knowing when to pivot or adjust strategy

2. **Communicating with the team to make sure everyone understands the what and the why** - Especially in times of change, ensuring alignment with clarity to move forward

3. **Operating with serious urgency to get something done when it's at the top of the list** - Acting decisively on what matters most

4. **Delicately balancing what matters in the near term to what will matter in the long run** - Short-term vs. long-term trade-offs

5. **Knowing what needs to be perfect to be "done" and what is fine leaving imperfect to move on** - The art of good enough vs. perfect

6. **At the end of the day, achieving or exceeding the goals that were set** - Results matter

## The Question to Ask Yourself

Your ability to prioritize well may be one of the most important skills for you to build the next big thing. **What are you doing to hone it, today?**
