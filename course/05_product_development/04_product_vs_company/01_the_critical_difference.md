# The Critical Difference

Most cybersecurity founders get exposed to the industry through products—tools they use to do their job. This makes sense: as domain experts, they're paid to ensure their organization is secure. They need to either build solutions in-house or use those provided by third-party vendors.

When security practitioners run into pain points with available tools, they notice gaps, issues, and opportunities that can be solved by building a better product. Some decide to build an open-source project. Others choose to start a company.

**But here's the problem:** Both security engineers and non-engineers are predominantly exposed to the vendor market through their products, technical documentation, and customer success. What they don't see is:

- Hiring
- Building company culture
- Solving human resources issues
- Running operations
- Managing payroll
- Marketing
- Investor relations
- And myriad other areas critical to running the company

**Because a large number of security practitioners don't understand the difference between building a product and building a company, when they become startup founders, many tend to over-invest in building, and under-invest in areas equally critical to the company's success.**

This isn't just a cybersecurity problem. It applies to any domain expert starting a company—whether you're a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or designer.

**To mitigate this:** Look for ways to get exposure to the inner workings of startups. Angel investing, advising early-stage founders, or working at a startup can help. Understand that building the product is just one part of building the company.
