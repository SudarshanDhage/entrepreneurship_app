- **Key Concepts:** MVP, minimum viable product, minimum viable experiment, product development, assumption validation. Key insight: MVPs often don't need code, but teams forget this. Organizations are so used to solving every problem with software that they forget they can learn what they need by faster, more efficient means. The minimum viable experiment asks: "What's the smallest test we can run to validate our riskiest assumption?" Before writing code, ask: (1) What's the riskiest assumption we're making? (2) What's the smallest test we can run to validate it? (3) Does that test require code, or can we learn faster without it? Example: Insurance company wanted customers to take photos instead of sending photographers. Instead of building an app, first test if customer photos are adequate—ask customers to email photos and see if adjusters can use them. This takes days, costs nothing, and validates the core assumption. Only after validating that assumption would software make sense.

## Signs You Aren't Really Building a Minimum Viable Product

- **Key Concepts:** MVP, minimum viable product, validated learning, build-measure-learn loop, assumption validation, success criteria. Key insight: Most so-called "MVPs" are not really MVPs because they are not focused on the process of learning, and as a result, wasteful. MVP is not a minimal product, it is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers. "The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." MVPs can be many things: landing pages, paper prototypes, pretending to be a magical algorithm, etc. Concerns when MVP term is used loosely: (1) little emphasis on what assumptions the MVP seeks to validate, (2) no clear success or failure criteria, (3) there might be an easier way to learn. The build-measure-learn (BML) loop should be thought through in reverse—first focus on what we want to learn, then how we'll measure it, then how we should build. Any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste. Three key questions: (1) What are you trying to learn? (2) What data are you collecting? (3) What determines success or failure?

## For God's Sake, Follow the Lean Startup Method

- **Key Concepts:** Lean Startup, MVP, pivot, validated learning, risk management, overfunding, VC landscape. Key insight: Most people have read the Lean Startup but haven't understood the key message. The article addresses criticisms and updates the method for 2024. MVP spectrum: 0 (idea) to 100 (final product), with X being the risk factor. MVP isn't minimum effort, it's minimum *viable*—the tool to test hypotheses. The cost of producing software has decreased, but the cost of creating a differentiated MVP has increased. Consumer expectations have risen, but that's separate from what an MVP is. Pivoting has evolved: pivot not just because first idea isn't working, but because you've found one that is. Overfunding is now a risk—capital abundance doesn't mean you should burn fast. Stripe example: $20M in bank, took 6 months to hire first 2 people. Lean Startup doesn't apply to top 1% well-funded "blockbuster startups" (Quibi, Powa Technologies examples). For 99% of startups: validate ideas, test hypotheses early, stay grounded, do simple things extremely well.

## Product-Driven versus Customer-Driven

- **URL:** https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/04/24/product-driven-versus-customer-driven/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product-driven businesses, customer-driven businesses, product strategy, business philosophy, Lean Startup critique, Steve Jobs, innovation, market creation, disruption, anomie, authoritah, True Auteur North, MVP, pivot, pattern recognition, new-game assumption
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive framework distinguishing two fundamentally different approaches to building businesses. Product-driven businesses develop visions inside-out, create customers and wealth by selling structure into anomie (undefined restless energy), require an "indispensable asshole at the top" who is an instrument of "what technology wants," and expand markets absolutely. Customer-driven businesses develop visions outside-in through pattern recognition, steal rather than create customers (wealth redistribution, not creation), assume stable behaviors that don't change, and operate in zero-sum or negative-sum ways. Key distinctions: (1) Product-driven is NOT auteur-driven (singular vision within limited scope), itch-driven (personal convenience sampling), or formalism-driven (codified processes replacing asshole). (2) Cannot hybridize - attempts like Lean Startup create "visioning-process debt" where inside-out and outside-in drives eventually conflict. The pivot is insufficient to resolve this. (3) Product-driven sells structure (experience structure) while customer-driven sells happiness/solutions to existing patterns. (4) The "new-game assumption" - product-driven is better now because old economy is seizing up (stealing customers harder), new economy keeps growing. Question: boundless frontier (secular change) vs cyclic (50-70 year cycles, back to customer-driven in 30-50 years). Examples: Apple (P) vs Microsoft (C), Pixar (P) vs Dreamworks (C), Google (P) vs Samsung (C), Facebook (P) vs LinkedIn (C). Edge cases: Amazon and Elon Musk appear customer-driven but are product-driven (disruption is side-effect, TAN lies in new markets). Answers: build product-driven (easier to find money), cannot transform (DNA), product-driven is better (for now), identify by indispensable asshole at top aligned to TAN, suits winners/product-driven personalities, cannot hybridize (no-man's-land), don't listen to customers (they don't exist yet if product-driven).

## Platforms vs Products: The Steve Yegge Rant

- **Source:** GitHub Gist (originally internal Google+ post accidentally made public)
- **Author:** Steve Yegge (worked at Amazon for 6.5 years, Google for 6.5 years)
- **URL:** https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Platforms, products, platform strategy, service-oriented architecture (SOA), APIs, accessibility, Amazon, Google, Jeff Bezos, platform-first thinking, externalizability, "eat your own dogfood", infrastructure as platform
- **Key Insight:** Legendary rant comparing Amazon (platform-first) vs Google (product-first). Core thesis: "A platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product." Amazon's transformation: Jeff Bezos's 2002 mandate forced all teams to expose data/functionality through service interfaces, designed from ground up to be externalizable (exposed to outside developers). Result: Amazon transformed into service-oriented architecture culturally, enabled AWS (infrastructure as platform). Google's failure: Google doesn't "get" platforms - exemplified by Google+ which launched with no API, then one measly API call. Problem is cultural: PMs, engineers, product teams don't get platforms. Internal war between minority "Platformers" vs "Mighty Funded Confident Producters." Key principle: Platforms solve accessibility - you can't build one product right for everyone, but platforms enable third-party developers to build right product for everyone. Accessibility is "the most important thing in computing world" - more important than security (dialing accessibility to zero = no product, security to zero can still have product). The Golden Rule: "Eat Your Own Dogfood" = "Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything." Can't bolt it on later - ten times as much work. Amazon's SOA discoveries at scale: pager escalation harder (20 service calls), every peer team potential DOS attacker (need quotas/throttling), monitoring and QA are same thing (recursive semantics checking), service discovery essential (universal registry), debugging harder (need debuggable sandboxes). Bezos's realizations: (1) Infrastructure can be repurposed as platform (AWS), (2) Can't build right thing for everyone - enable third parties instead. Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook get platforms. Google doesn't. Problem: Google is product company through and through - wild success with search biased them. Solution requires dramatic cultural change - "not getting it" endemic across company. We're trying to predict what people want and deliver it - can't do that reliably. Only few people like Steve Jobs could. Enable others instead. Facebook successful because built entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do work. Platform needs killer app (Facebook itself for Facebook Platform), but serious mistake to conclude app could be successful without platform. Key takeaways: Platforms beat products, platforms solve accessibility, eat your own dogfood, start with platform use it for everything, no cheating (no secret back doors), Bezos's mandate worked, can't predict what people want - enable others, it's cultural problem.
