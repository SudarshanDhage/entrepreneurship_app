# The One Big Customer Trap

**It's hard to beat the feeling of relief upon landing that first big customer.**

All of the blood, sweat, and tears spent toiling away at the first version of your product seem to be—at least, temporarily—worth it. Now you have proof that somebody somewhere actually wants your product.

This new customer, your first, is a big established entity. Not only do they want to use your product, they want to buy everything you have in stock, and then send you back to the lab to make more.

And they are willing to part with a hefty sum for the privilege of being your first customer—**in advance!** They are so big that they can part with a figure that represents a year's revenue for you without so much as breaking a sweat.

**Beware. It's a trap.**

Joe's company was a small web development shop, about ten employees total. In the last year, Joe had attempted to pivot from a services company to a product company. They had developed an idea for a platform that, if done right, could be very successful.

Joe's product vision seemed to be just what the customer wanted initially. The partnership seemed like a no-brainer. Advanced pay transferred and received, Joe's team sprang into action.

But the features the customer was asking for did not align with their long term plans for the product. Joe had to engineer a special version for the customer, keep building a core version on a separate branch. There was so much work that Joe had to hire two more engineers, as well as a project manager. And he had to turn away all new customers.

**Desperate to please the customer, Joe began to cut back on the core product team's time, reassigning them to help out with the client's custom version.** Eventually, Joe had to put the core (non-revenue generating) platform work on hold entirely in order to add team members to the customer's work.

Finally, things came to a head. One final payment seemed to be taking a while. Joe called the customer.

**The customer very calmly informed him that no further payment was forthcoming.** The client acknowledged that Joe and his team had done everything they were asked. But the customers' investors were growing increasingly impatient, and had decided to cut funding for the project.

**Joe checked his cash projections spreadsheet, having to first remove the now routine monthly payments by this customer from the calculation. Lots of red suddenly appeared.** This customer represented, it turned out, nearly 80% of Joe's revenues. Basically, they paid everyone's salary. And now they were suddenly and abruptly gone.

Joe opened his CRM program. He had to reset his password to gain access. That's how long it had been since he'd used it. Of course, Joe found only long-dead leads.

After nearly ten years in business, Joe had committed a critical error. **He had put all of his eggs in one basket.**

**Problem-Solution Fit vs. Product-Market Fit**

There are two main phases to getting a product off the ground. The first is basically validating that you are actually solving a problem that customers have, and that you can build a solution they will pay for. The second is validating that you can do this for a large number of similar customers at scale.

**When you are just getting started, you need to talk to a number of different customers for each iteration of your product.** Talking to just one customer, no matter how well-heeled, is not validation that your product meets the needs of any distinct customer segment.

**Your first customer is not a customer segment.** It validates only that this particular customer has a need. And what they need is you.

**Revenue Is Not The Only Metric**

This is one of those rare cases where revenue is not necessarily validation. Or at least, revenue alone. Focusing on revenue alone does not give you any information about the growth prospects of your company.

When your large customer wants you to make a boat, and your plan was to make an airplane, do you have the option to say no? What would happen if you just refused?

**Once you've tied your prospects, and your checkbook, to a single large customer, their product roadmap is now your product roadmap.**

**One Big Customer Makes You A Consultant, Not a Startup**

Earning 80% of your total revenue from one customer can lead to disaster if they suddenly cut work to you.

I have seen this pattern more times than I can count. The startup is driven by the momentum of a single large customer. Everything that happens in the company bends around the will of that customer. In short, **the team becomes essentially just another vendor, consultant, or employee for the customer, rather than an independent company in its own right.**

The moment you land that first customer is the critical moment when you need to be the most disciplined. You need to look carefully at your vision, your roadmap, and your metrics, and make sure that by taking this customer's money, you are not committing a dangerous, and in fact a fatal, error.

**How to Avoid The Trap:**

1. **Don't target large customers first.** Start with smaller customers, and work your way up only after you've nailed that segment.

2. **Avoid SOWs.** As soon as you find yourself reviewing a Scope of Work agreement to modify or customize your product in order to make the sale, you have ceased to be a product company. Congratulations, you're a consulting company now.

3. **Don't be "open for business" until you have multiple customers.** It's a lot easier to resist the pull of any one picky customer if you have 4 or 5 or 20 others you have to satisfy.

4. **Spread revenue across customers.** Always avoid an imbalance in any single customer providing the bulk of your revenue.

5. **Don't eat your seed corn.** Always keep some of your capacity open for developing new capabilities that do not directly service your existing customers. Do not fill your product backlog with wish-lists from your customers.
