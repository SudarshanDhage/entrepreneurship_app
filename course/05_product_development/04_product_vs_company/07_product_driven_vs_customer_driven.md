# Product-Driven versus Customer-Driven

A framework for understanding two fundamentally different approaches to building businesses, and why the distinction matters more than ever in the new economy.

## The Central Questions

This distinction is central to many questions people ask in business:

1. Which kind of business should you build?
2. Can you transform your business from one kind to the other?
3. Is one kind provably better than the other?
4. How can you tell which kind is which?
5. Which kind suits your personality?
6. Can you hybridize the two and get the best of both worlds?
7. Should you listen to customers?

These questions have been discussed for decades, but the conversation has gained new urgency in recent years. The reason? **Steve Jobs.** His life and work suggested a set of polarizing, absolutist answers that have historically attracted hedged answers beginning with "it depends."

## Product-Driven Absolutism

The polarizing answers inspired by Steve Jobs and embraced by Silicon Valley:

1. **Which kind of business should you build?** Product-driven.
2. **Can you transform?** No, it's DNA.
3. **Is one better?** Yes; product-driven.
4. **How can you tell?** There's an indispensable asshole at the top for product-driven.
5. **Which suits your personality?** If you're a winner, product-driven.
6. **Can you hybridize?** No. You must choose.
7. **Should you listen to customers?** No.

These answers seem insane on the face of it. So why is this extreme position taken seriously?

**The new-game assumption:** There's a widespread belief that we're not in a business-as-usual regime; that the future is not like the past; that pre-2000 business theories must defer to post-2000 Silicon Valley theories. The rules of business in the new game are different.

## Examples

**Product-driven businesses** develop visions inside-out starting with internal processes:
- Apple under Jobs (vs Microsoft under Ballmer)
- Pixar (vs Dreamworks)
- Google (vs Samsung)
- Facebook (vs LinkedIn)

**Customer-driven businesses** develop visions outside-in starting with patterns in the marketplace.

**Important edge cases:** Amazon and Elon Musk's ventures don't quite fit neatly into either category, but both are ultimately product-driven despite appearing to disrupt existing markets.

## What Product-Driven Is NOT

Product-driven is often confused with three related but distinct approaches:

### 1. Auteur-Driven Businesses

Auteur-driven businesses look like the realization of a singular vision of a dominant personality. However, auteur-like tendencies are necessary but not sufficient for product-driven businesses.

If that's all you have, you get idiosyncratic businesses like Richard Branson's empire, Dyson's gadgets, or Dean Kamen's Segway. These create entertaining spectacles but rarely create top-tier businesses in terms of size, historical impact, and profitability.

The key difference: Auteurs seek to get their way within a limited scope. The signature style is associated with the individual, not the product. Product-driven requires something more: a sense of absolute necessity that the world must be a certain way.

### 2. Itch-Driven/Passion-Driven Businesses

Many programmers confuse scratching a personal itch with product-orientation. Everybody reacts to bureaucratic tedium by developing a private itch to just build something. But itch-scratching isn't product-orientation.

There's no good reason to believe an itch represents a "dent in the universe" level of opportunity. It may merely be a break-out-of-gridlock level of opportunity or a personal ticket out of frustration.

Itch-scratching is a signal-and-noise hack: you respond to noisy signals about what might be marketable by building something that responds to a very clean and reliable signal — your own. But convenience sampling (using what's easily available) doesn't necessarily mean you've found something profound.

### 3. Formalism-Driven Businesses

Formalisms (TRIZ, Design Thinking, etc.) differ in a crucial way: they don't need an asshole-at-the-top. They're based on the assumption that the asshole is dispensable, and whatever they bring can be codified into processes.

**The problem:** Formalism-driven businesses don't really work. The assholes-at-the-top are in fact indispensable. Either the formal process is a theatrical sham covering up the real process, or the business is not profitable.

## The "Just-Add-Grown-Ups" Fallacy

A common characteristic of inside-out drives is that they seem playful, disconnected from the real world, and capricious. So a tradition of innovation models emerged based on the idea that to make inside-out drives workable, you just need to add adult supervision.

**This is a fallacy.** What is needed is a way to keep adult-supervision out for as long as possible (preferably until sustained and predictable profitability), not to add it as soon as possible.

The most common way to add a grown-up element is to add a "listening to customers" element. But product-driven absolutists do not want to listen to customers — just like children absorbed in play do not want to listen to adults.

## The Lean Startup Hybrid Model

The Lean Startup model attempts to hybridize product-driven and customer-driven thinking. It hopes that by changing who you listen to and how, you can fit a voice-of-customer forcing function without compromising a fundamentally product-driven process.

**The approach:** Instead of focus groups targeting existing markets, Lean Startups look for atypical "early evangelist" customers who are both visionary about their needs and poorly served by existing solutions.

**The tension:** There's no obvious way to prevent progressive refinement of the MVP from tugging the product away from the True Auteur North (TAN). A zone of "lurking demons" is created — call it visioning-process debt.

**The pivot:** The Lean Startup tries to resolve this with the notion of a pivot — the strategic reorientation that periodically pays down visioning-process debt. But there's no comparable metis around pivoting compared to refactoring in programming.

**The fundamental problem:** You cannot have the product-driven cake and eat the customer-driven one too. This pits conflicting forces against each other. Unless the project is incredibly lucky or informed by godly foresight, inside-out drives and outside-in drives eventually have a falling out.

**The evidence:** The continued failure of pure Lean Startup thinking to open up huge new markets suggests there is no middle ground. The twain shall never meet.

## What Product-Driven Actually Is: Selling Structure

**Product-driven businesses sell structure.** Specifically, experience structure.

### Customer-Driven: Selling Happiness and Solutions

Customer-driven businesses sell two things:
1. **Happiness** — fueling an existing desire-satisfying experience
2. **Solutions to problems** — presupposing the existence of a broken experience

This view makes sense if you define "customer" as "a novel and stable pattern of human behavior."

Customer-driven businesses assume the existence of customers (stable patterns of behavior) with clear desires or problems. You accept the stable behaviors you find and try to feed them better. **You accept that people don't change. In fact you bet on their not changing.**

### The Create/Steal Distinction

Customer-driven businesses **cannot create customers** in the Druckerian sense. They can only steal them from other existing businesses. This means they are not true wealth-creating businesses. They are wealth redistribution businesses. Their DNA is deeply mercantilist rather than Schumpeterian/innovative.

Product-driven businesses, by contrast:
- Expand markets in an absolute sense
- Create customers, and therefore wealth
- Are marketing-driven in a deep way: they "make people want things" rather than "make things people want"

### Anomie and Structure

Product-driven businesses create customers by selling structure into **anomie** — a state where potential customers are in undefined restless energy and undirected curiosity. They yearn for structure but haven't found it yet.

Only children can endure extended periods of undirected, improvised play without experiencing anxiety. Adults inevitably start seeking ways to structure their anomic behaviors.

An anomic situation is full of dissolved potential from which many kinds of structure could emerge. **Anomie is the primordial soup from which new markets emerge.** Some stimulus — an irritant — is needed to precipitate structure out of this potential.

This is why product-driven businesses reverse the customer-driven mantra: they sell vitamins, not aspirin. A "vitamin" is a sufficient but not necessary stimulus that precipitates structure out of a potential field of anomic behaviors.

## Authoritah as Structure-Precipitating Irritant

This ultimately explains why an asshole-at-the-top is necessary, and is necessarily an asshole.

Given a situation with nothing dictating a particular behavior as a necessity, most people will choose in relatively indifferent ways, or experience anxiety at having to make a choice. But there are some to whom a particular sufficient path seems absolutely necessary.

The **authoritah-figure** feels compelled by a sense of absolute necessity that the world has to be a certain way. They are as helpless as the ones they dominate: they are instruments of "what technology wants" rather than what they might themselves want as ordinary humans.

**Authoritah works by wearing down the collective.** It becomes so exhausting to penetrate the relentless barrage that you end up yielding. You've been assimilated into a reality distortion field.

**The distinction from auteurs:** Auteurs only seek to get their way within a limited scope. Authoritah-figures not only want to play, but want others to play their way within the fullest possible scope in the real universe. That's where the "dent in the universe" motivation comes from.

## Creating Customers

Product-driven businesses precipitate structure by:
- Stealthily extending existing behaviors
- Metaphorically overloading behaviors
- Hacking imitation tendencies
- Creating social proof
- Channeling group dynamics

**Early path dependency matters:** Product-driven businesses create customers in an absolute sense that cannot be gamed. You cannot get from "early evangelist customers" to revolutionary products via a codified process. There is an a priori synthetic element that is neither discoverable by outside-in processes nor negotiable within a codified dialectic.

**Not just any irritant will do:** The processes have to grow around the specific character of the unique irritant that works. Because that character is central to being an instrument of the technological imperative.

## What Customer-Driven Actually Is: Pattern Recognition

Hopefully, clarifying product-driven has usefully muddied the apparently clear definition of customer-driven.

**The apparently clear definition:** A customer-driven business uses codified listening processes to figure out what people want, and then builds it.

**Why it's only apparently clear:** To "listen" to a customer (a pattern of behavior) is to engage in pattern recognition. But a pattern that is stable is by definition not novel except under two conditions: you created the stability, or it is merely novel to you.

- **Product-driven businesses create the stability and therefore the novelty.**
- **Customer-driven businesses discover novel-to-them patterns.**

Such patterns can only exist in two places:
1. **Inside the closely guarded core of incumbent markets** — where competitors try to obscure your understanding. You recognize hidden patterns from incomplete information. This is attacking a core.
2. **In the interstices and margins of existing markets** — where nobody previously looked, or looked but didn't care. You recognize neglected patterns. With appropriate leverage, you might make the marginal niche a new core. That's classical disruption.

**In neither case are you creating customers.** You are stealing them or reprioritizing the importance of different segments.

## The New-Game Assumption

**The big question:** Are we in a world where there's room for both approaches, or are we in a world where product-driven businesses represent vast opportunities while customer-driven ones represent limited and shrinking opportunities?

**The evidence for a new game:**

The industrial economy is gradually seizing up in a gridlock of entrenched industry structures. Stealing customers from competitors is increasingly difficult and expensive. Margins are shrinking, revenues are flatlining, and maneuvering room is being squeezed out.

On the other side, the new economy just seems to keep growing. Things keep getting easier to do, rather than harder.

**The question of sustainability:** There are two ways product-driven could be absolutely better into the future:

1. **Boundless frontier model:** We're at the start of unbridled growth in new market opportunities opened by the Internet. No matter how fast we run, the horizon recedes faster. There's been a secular change in the very nature of economic growth.

2. **Cyclic model:** We're at an extreme of a long-term cycle (50-70 years) beyond living memory. The last time conditions favored product-driven thinking was the 1930s. In another 30-50 years, we'll be back in a dominantly customer-driven phase.

It's not yet clear which is more likely, or whether there's an element of both.

## Answers to the Opening Questions

1. **Which kind should you build?** Product-driven, because it's far harder to find money to build customer-driven ones today in the old economy than product-driven ones in the new economy.

2. **Can you transform?** No, it's DNA. The only path between them is a near-death experience.

3. **Is one better?** Yes; product-driven. For now, while it remains easier to find anomic proto-markets to structure than to steal customers or disrupt existing markets.

4. **How can you tell?** There's an indispensable asshole at the top for product-driven. They are instruments of "what technology wants." If the entire company seems aligned to their True Auteur North, it's product-driven.

5. **Which suits your personality?** If you're a winner, product-driven. Being customer-driven by temperament (good at listening, pattern-recognition, high empathy) puts you on the wrong side of history. Being product-driven (wanting to make things, preference for first principles, desire to explore uncharted territories) puts you on the right side.

6. **Can you hybridize?** No. You must choose. The middle is a no-man's-land where business models get torn apart by attempting to conform to both inside-out and outside-in visions.

7. **Should you listen to customers?** No. If you're product-driven, they don't exist yet, so you actually can't until you create them first.
