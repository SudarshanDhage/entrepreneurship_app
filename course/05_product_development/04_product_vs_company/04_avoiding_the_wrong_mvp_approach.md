# Avoiding the Wrong MVP Approach

"We could make our customers happier and save the company a ton of money, all at the same time." That was the pitch behind an innovation team's new idea at a 120-year-old insurance company.

Yet, many at the company weren't convinced. They thought it could never work.

The innovation team's idea was conceptually simple: The insurance company's claims adjusters use photographs to assess the damage and fill out claims reports. Instead of sending professional photographers out to take the pictures of damaged vehicles and homes, they'd let customers send in their own pictures.

The company pays those photographers a lot of money. Plus, there aren't enough of them, so customers often have to wait. Customers often need to be present when the photographers show up, which means missing work or other responsibilities. The current process is slow, frustrating, and expensive.

On the surface, it seems like a great idea. However, there are questions to resolve. **Could customers take photos good enough for adjusters to do their job?** These photographers go through extensive training to ensure the pictures capture the right information.

## What About an MVP?

This is where teams often make a critical mistake. The immediate thought is: "Let's build an MVP! We'll create an app where customers can upload their photos."

But here's the problem: **MVPs often don't need code, but teams forget this.** Our organizations are so used to solving every problem with software that we forget that we can learn what we need by faster, more efficient means.

Before building any software, the insurance company needed to answer one simple question: Can customers take photos good enough for adjusters to do their job?

## The Right MVP Approach

Instead of building an app, they could:

1. **Test with real photos first** - Ask a few customers to take photos with their phones and email them in. See if adjusters can actually use them.

2. **Validate the core assumption** - The core risk isn't whether customers can use an app (that's a solved problem). The core risk is whether customer-taken photos contain enough information for claims processing.

3. **Learn fast and cheap** - This test takes days, not months. It costs nothing. And it answers the most important question.

Only after validating that customers can take adequate photos would it make sense to build software to streamline the process. But if the photos aren't good enough, you've saved months of development time and learned the idea won't work without first training customers on photography—which changes the entire approach.

## The Minimum Viable Experiment

Some teams use the phrase "minimum viable experiment" instead of MVP to differentiate from the bias people have about code = product.

The minimum viable experiment asks: **What's the smallest test we can run to validate our riskiest assumption?**

In this case:
- **Riskiest assumption:** Customers can take photos good enough for claims processing
- **Smallest test:** Ask customers to take photos and see if adjusters can use them
- **No code required**

## The Key Insight

**MVPs don't always need to be products.** They need to be the minimum viable *experiment* that validates your riskiest assumption.

Before writing a single line of code, ask:
1. What's the riskiest assumption we're making?
2. What's the smallest test we can run to validate it?
3. Does that test require code, or can we learn faster without it?

If you can learn without building, do that first. Code comes later, after you've validated that the idea actually works.
