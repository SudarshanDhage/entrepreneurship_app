# Taste the Soup

Dan Robinson recounted a story of Heap's goal to have every single employee "taste the soup."

**For the quarter, every single Heap employee—from engineers to salespeople to HR folks—was required to engage with the Heap product.**

Dan mentioned that the night before the deadline, he and the CEO were furiously direct messaging folks on Slack making sure they would finish this requirement.

**Here's a CTO of a 200+ person company going out of his way to create a culture of product focus.**

When asked why, Dan pointed out that it's relatively easy for the entire team to have a deep understanding of the product in the early days of a startup. However, **as Heap expanded, maintaining this depth of knowledge and empathy with users became harder and harder.**

Therefore, a sustained focus on the product became even more crucial—it was the only way to get everyone aligned on how to create a great product.

**The lesson:** Product culture doesn't happen by accident. You have to fight for it. As you scale, actively create processes and requirements that keep everyone connected to the product.

**Execution, execution, execution:** Most businesses come down to how well you can make a product that matches your user's needs. And that requires everyone—not just product and engineering—to understand what you're building.

**Dan closed with this:** Startups ultimately have to build something that people find valuable enough to pay money for. It's one of the most basic observations, but often the basic things are the most important.
