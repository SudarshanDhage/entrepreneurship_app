# Scaling Product Delivery: The "Dirty" Secret of High Performing Product Teams

The dirty secret of Silicon Valley is that most great product teams follow a system that resembles waterfall (gasp!) to launch new innovative features or products repeatedly.

The system starts with high conviction based on judgment, intuition, and instinct rather than relying on iterative customer feedback to build conviction over time in order to scale product delivery.

## The Need for Repeated Big Bets

The process of going from 0 to 1 with a first product is an innovation. It's what allows the company to get off the ground. Sometimes, that original innovation is enough to carry a company from seed to IPO. But that is incredibly rare. **What's more common is that companies need to ship big bets over and over in order to create step changes that help them scale.**

Consider Stripe's product launches from the past 4 years: Atlas, Sigma, Radar, Billing, Issuing, Terminal, Corporate Card, Capital, Climate, Treasury. Or Credit Karma's launches: Email Re-platform, CK Tax, CK Home, CK UK, CK Savings. Or Wealthfront's: 529 Plans, Borrowing/Credit Line, Financial Planning, Risk Parity, Savings Account, Debit Card, Auto Pilot.

But this doesn't just exist in fintech. Snap in consumer social, HubSpot and Drift in B2B SaaS, and more have been able to execute on this system. There are also companies that have not been able to do this, such as Evernote and Yahoo. So what is the difference?

## The Religion of Agile or Lean

"Agile" or "Lean" — processes that emphasize short development timelines and small iterations — have been heavily emphasized in Silicon Valley for the past decade. While there is a time and place for those systems, they:

- **Do not enable shipping big bets repeatably.**
- **Lead companies/individuals to be less willing to take big swings.**
- **Consistently fail companies when they realize they need a step function change.**

High-performing product teams don't religiously subscribe to one tool for all problems. They recognize that through a company's lifetime, different problems arise that each requires a different tool.

**One of the most underrepresented tools in the tool belt right now is being able to build, orchestrate, and manage a system that enables teams to accept and manage the uncertainty of high risk, high reward bets.** Not having this tool cripples both company growth and the growth of an individual's product or engineering career.

## The Gradient of Execution

One major axis of career progression is the scope of the problem/solution that you are responsible for executing on:

1. **Maintain + Execute An Enhancement** → You start by owning quality execution on the enhancement on a small area of the product.
2. **Maintain and Evolve a Feature** → You progress to owning execution on an individual feature.
3. **Maintain and Evolve a Group of Features** → Then you are expected to be able to maintain and evolve a moderately-sized part of the product stack.
4. **Launch Something New End-to-End** → Then you are expected to be able to go from maintaining/evolving to launching something new end-to-end with higher complexity and scope.

Being able to manage the end to end launch of broader, larger, more complex, higher risk, higher reward initiatives is critical to progressing in Product and Engineering.

But many get stuck around steps 3 and 4.

### Why People Get Stuck

**The Grey Area Grows:** The larger scale the project the more ambiguity there is in strategic decisions and tactical tradeoffs. Engineers especially are trained to find the "right" answer. Leaders get bogged down in trying to make the best decision but increase the time spent on the wrong decisions. As you progress in your career, **focusing on ways to get to fast, efficient, and reasonable solutions ends up being more important than coming to the "right" answer.**

**Multiple Teams, Multiple Sequences:** Larger projects involve figuring out how to execute across multiple teams that you do not directly own in multiple sequences. Your influence abilities need to move from explicit to implicit. But a lot of people struggle with, "What do I do when I can't tell them what to do?"

## How Continuous Big Bets Drive Company Growth

Teams need to realize that every dimension of their business will inevitably face headwinds:

- **CAC Going Up** - Due to increased channel saturation, competition, or lower intent audiences
- **Available Target Market Decreasing** - As you grow into your target market, the remaining available target market shrinks
- **The Adjacent User** - As you grow, your product brings in lower-intent, more casual users that can lead to lower retention and monetization
- **Competition Increasing** - Copying a competitor's feature is standard business practice. The only way to win is to be the one that is leading and pushing the line forward
- **Law of Large Numbers** - In order to maintain a healthy % growth, you need bigger and bigger absolute gains

As companies scale, they need standardized processes on how to build and launch new bets in order to drive additional growth. There are two types of these bets:

1. **Raising The Existing Ceiling** - Shipping new innovative features within your existing use cases can increase the ceiling on your existing product.
2. **Creating A New Ceiling** - At some point you can't find the gains needed just by raising the ceiling on your existing product. You need to go find entirely new adjacent products and use cases to create new ceilings.

These two methods point to the most common breaking points:

- **Series B+** - Many companies around the Series B stage finally get the financial and human capital to pull off multiple major initiatives at the same time, but they fail to develop a system that allows them to do so reliably.
- **Series D and Beyond** - In late-stage private companies, there typically comes a time where you need to start expanding your portfolio of products.

## The Messy Path From Strategic Idea To Outcome

In our head, we often envision the path from strategic idea to outcome as a clean straight line. In practice, so many things can derail you:

- **Uncertainty** muddies what the path forward will entail - it's unclear how much time it will take to build, what you'll need to build, or what other dependencies you'll face.
- **Risks manifest** that derail your efforts, such as facing a customer support constraint or losing access to a dependency team.
- **Misalignment** occurs that can prevent you from moving forward.
- **Cannibalization** is created because actions that you take in one area of the product have effects on other areas and can detract from one another.

So in reality, going from strategic idea to outcome is messy. **The best leaders and companies out there have a system to avoid enough of these "unforeseen" blockers or deal with them eloquently as they come up in order to deliver outcomes for their customers/users and the business time after time.**

## Recognizing The Signals Of Unscalable Product Execution

How do you know if you don't have a scalable system? Some of the signals:

### Late-stage blow-ups

There is a big idea the team is excited about. You spend months building something, but then in the homestretch right before you are ready to launch, an executive or cofounder drops in from above and says, "this isn't right, we can't launch it."

This happens because, between idea and outcome, the system (or lack thereof) creates communication and expectation gaps between what executives have in their heads and the reality of what is built along the way.

### Engineering + Product Grows, But What You Ship Doesn't

A task you were sure the team could have completed in a month ends up taking four months, even though the team working on it is bigger. You need a model for getting big things done that doesn't require the entire company to have to work on it as a top-down mandate.

### Endless Tradeoff Debates

When teams hit a fork in the road, there is no explicit belief or manifesto about what is most important. Delivering on time? Feature richness of the product? Quality of the experience? This devolves into an endless debate, or worse, being inconsistent throughout the process and optimizing in different directions.

### Growth Slows Despite Rapid Iterative Development

The team is shipping a higher frequency of things and running more experiments, but growth continues to slow. The natural tendency is to "dig in" and experiment more, but it is worth stepping back and evaluating whether or not the solution is that you just need to ship bigger bets.

### A Shift in Customer Feedback

When the team isn't shipping bigger bets frequently enough, the conversation shifts from people reaching out and asking for more, to people complaining about things that are broken.

## The Root Causes Limiting Product Delivery

There are four common root causes:

### No System

Some leaders have no standardized system to deliver large-scale initiatives. Each product and engineering team will unintentionally build products through different methods, leading to inconsistent delivery timelines and product quality.

How does this happen? Because we've all been trained that Waterfall is horrible and Agile is great. As a result, very few companies are willing to put a system in place that isn't Agile-informed, due to the backlash it could create. This leads the team to get stuck in small, iterative bets without the balance of shipping big bets.

### Applying the Wrong System

Going from strategic idea to outcome is solving a series of problems. Different tools solve different problems. Applying the wrong tool to the wrong problem can manifest in all the issues described above.

This most commonly comes in two forms. One, applying iterative systems with low process rigidity (like Agile) to large-scale work. And two, forcing a system from one company to the next, such as applying the Amazon-style press release to a culture that doesn't read.

### "We Have the Wrong People."

Companies commonly believe that it isn't a system problem but it is a people problem. But you can get the "right" type of people, and if you plug them into the wrong system, the outcome is going to be exactly the same. Teams need to recognize that there is no unicorn that is going to save them.

### Over-Relying on "Superstars"

A lot of times teams have their "10X ninja superstar." However, superstar resources are an unreliable way to scale. Superstars can only take on so many projects and have a limited influence on the broader execution system. **The goal shouldn't be to try and hire more of the superstars, but to deconstruct and institutionalize the things that creates a superstar.**

## The Keys To Product Delivery At Scale

### Build a Specific System for Large Product Bets

All product problems are not created equal. There are 4 different types of product problems:

1. **Feature Work** - Creating and capturing value by extending a product's functionality and market into incremental and adjacent areas.
2. **Growth Work** - Creating and capturing value by accelerating adoption and usage by the existing market.
3. **Scaling Work** - Focusing on bottlenecks to ensure the team can continue to move forward and take on new levels of feature, growth, and product-market fit expansion work.
4. **Product-Market Fit Expansion** - Increasing the ceiling on product-market fit in a non-incremental way by expanding into an adjacent market, adjacent product, or both.

**If you want to ship big innovative bets at scale, you cannot use the same execution system that teams use for more iterative work.** You need to design a system and train the teams on how to use and when to use it.

### Manage the Complexity, Don't Try to Remove It

When creating and managing the system, the common tendency is try and remove complexity entirely. But this is impossible. There will always be a level of uncertainty involved in executing innovative and uncertain strategic ideas. **Instead, you need to accept the uncertainty by building processes that mitigate this complexity, increase conviction, and reduce risk over time.**

Some of the keys to managing complexity:

**Agile Inspiration, Not Religion:** The right system takes inspiration from two core agile principles but does not throw waterfall away in the process. Specifically:
- **Short timelines to workable prototypes** - Teams need to know how to get to workable prototypes in short time frames (weeks, not months). If you don't, this creates a negative flywheel where larger bets feel riskier and riskier due to longer windows of validation.
- **Acceptance of new insights during development** - There also needs to be a deliberate focus on finding new insights during development and having a way to accept and incorporate these new learnings.

**Having A Tolerance For Misfires:** Sometimes the price of admission for being a company that's oriented around repeated big bets is you get slapped on the wrist, make a mistake, or have misfires. But that needs to be OK.

**Deliberate Tradeoff Decision Framework:** You can't foresee everything at the beginning of the execution process. It is inevitable that something will come up that forces a tradeoff decision between delivery time, complexity or feature richness of the product, and quality of the experience. Everyone needs to have a structured and deliberate approach to the decision.

**Codified Check Points With Specific Purposes:** Part of having a defined system is to have codified checkpoints throughout the journey, each with their own specific purpose. Teams fall into two traps. One, using the same Product Review for all checkpoints in the process when you actually need different formats. Two, teams know that they should do Product Reviews, but have never been trained how to do them extremely well.

### Communicating the System

When implementing a system, the struggle begins with how it is communicated. This often manifests as execs saying, "We need XYZ process to make better products." The engineering and product teams then think, "Great, the execs just want to watch everything we do."

**The "why" behind the process is what matters and should drive the narrative.** Start by asking teams what they hated about how you built products, validate those pain points, propose creating formal steps to prevent those mistakes, and engage the leads in creating the method so they feel bought into it.

### Know and Customize to Your Superpower

The system that you design for innovative product delivery within your company needs to be tailored to your specific business, to the customer you're serving, and to the market that you're competing in because not all companies are the same.

The great companies are those that understand that each step in the process is an atomic unit that they can mold and adapt to suit their exact needs. They eventually pick one part of the process that they turn into their "superpower." Common examples of this are Amazon's Press Release or Airbnb's 7 Star Review.
