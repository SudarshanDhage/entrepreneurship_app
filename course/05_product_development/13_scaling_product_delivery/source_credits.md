- **Key Insight:** "The dirty secret of Silicon Valley is that most great product teams follow a system that resembles waterfall (gasp!) to launch new innovative features or products repeatedly." System starts with high conviction based on judgment, intuition, and instinct rather than iterative customer feedback. Companies need to ship big bets over and over to create step changes. Agile/Lean don't enable shipping big bets repeatably, lead to less willingness to take big swings, fail when companies need step function change. High-performing teams don't religiously subscribe to one tool - recognize different problems require different tools. Gradient of execution (career progression): Maintain enhancement → Evolve feature → Evolve group of features → Launch something new end-to-end. Many get stuck at steps 3-4 due to: (1) Grey area grows - more ambiguity, leaders bogged down in "right" answer vs fast/reasonable solutions, (2) Multiple teams/sequences - influence needs to move from explicit to implicit. Continuous big bets drive company growth - every dimension faces headwinds (CAC going up, target market decreasing, adjacent users, competition increasing, law of large numbers). Two types of bets: (1) Raising existing ceiling - innovative features within existing use cases, (2) Creating new ceiling - new adjacent products/use cases. Common breaking points: Series B+ (have resources but no system), Series D+ (need to expand product portfolio). Messy path from strategic idea to outcome - uncertainty, risks, misalignment, cannibalization derail execution. Signals of unscalable execution: Late-stage blow-ups (exec gaps between idea and reality), Eng+Product grows but output doesn't, endless tradeoff debates, growth slows despite rapid iteration, shift in customer feedback from asking for more to complaining. Root causes: (1) No system - teams build through different methods, stuck in small iterative bets, (2) Wrong system - applying Agile to large-scale work, forcing company-specific systems, (3) "Wrong people" - no unicorn saves you, wrong system = same outcome, (4) Over-relying on superstars - unreliable scaling, need to deconstruct/institutionalize what creates superstar. Keys to delivery at scale: (1) Build specific system for large product bets - 4 types of product work (Feature, Growth, Scaling, PMF Expansion), can't use same system for iterative work, (2) Manage complexity don't remove it - agile inspiration not religion (short timelines to prototypes, accept new insights), tolerance for misfires, deliberate tradeoff framework, codified checkpoints with specific purposes, (3) Communicate the system - "why" matters, engage teams in creating method, (4) Know and customize to superpower - tailor to business/customer/market, mold atomic units, pick one part as superpower (e.g., Amazon Press Release, Airbnb 7 Star Review).
