# Intellectual Honesty in User Conversations

YCombinator famously says you should only do two things at your startup: **"write code [and] talk to users."**

But here's the thing: **It's really hard to talk to users in the right way and not bias them in the wrong ways.**

Dan Robinson mentioned a product at Heap that didn't work out. Heap had many internal meetings about how to build this product and how it would fit into Heap's future strategy. Only once most of this had been figured out did they talk to customers.

**This led to customer conversations like:**
- "If you could have X, would you use it?"
- "Do you think X is a good idea?"

**These questions are predisposed to cause your users to say nice things to you.** A user can always say "yes, I'd use it" but they don't have any skin in the game. You're also not getting any useful information on how valuable your product is.

**For Heap's next product launch (which was much more successful), Dan ensured the team got very precise about how they would learn about what users wanted.**

He asked questions like:
- **"How would you articulate the value of this product to your teammate?"** (helps you identify how the user thinks about the value of the product)
- **"What have you already done to solve your problem?"** (helps determine how much of a problem it really is)

He also asked for pilot users to pay. **That's the true determiner of how valuable a product is.**

**Ultimately, Dan said this all came down to intellectual honesty.**

The best way to build a useless product for months is by letting your excitement influence the conversations you have with users. Instead, focus on trying to be as unbiased as possible on the most important problems that users are actually facing.

Don't ask leading questions. Don't try to validate what you want to hear. Ask questions that reveal truth—even if it's uncomfortable.
