- **Key Insight:** Practical lessons from a year building event/ticket management startup (tens of thousands tickets sold). Core principle: "The size of your backlog is inversely proportional to how often you talk to customers." Replace planning time with talking to customers - the what should come from customer, planning time should focus on how to build. Large backlogs = high unvalidated assumptions, low customer value. More proxies between developer and customer = less product meets customer needs. Reduce UI design time, focus on technical component design - basic UI 60% right is enough, hone through feedback. Product's capacity to implement UI feedback more important than initial UI. Small components and low-level reusability key. Speed is function of technical debt. Observe customers using app (PostHog session replay) - qualitative complements quantitative. Hyrum's Law corollary: "What you intend to be not clickable will be clicked." Implement account spoofing for admin to use app as specific production user - makes testing/diagnosis easy, reduces test data need. Page one real estate critical - most relevant info, sparse content. If user reaching for menu on page one, UI is wrong. Customer is most important marketer - NPS indicates if customers stake reputation. Better to have 100 people love you than million sort of like you (Brian Chesky). Focus on smaller set of happy, referring customers vs casting wider net. MVPs pointless without iteration - not excuse for poor experience, but to answer: (1) Enough customer value to continue? (2) What technical improvements needed for scale? (3) Makes dent in key goals or distraction? These questions can't be answered without shipping to production.
