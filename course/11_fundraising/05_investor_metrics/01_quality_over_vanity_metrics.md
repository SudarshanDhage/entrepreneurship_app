# Quality Over Vanity Metrics

**Growing startups and evaluating startups share common skills.**

The steps for starting and scaling a new startup share many of the same skills as investing in a new startup:
1. First, understand the existing state of customer growth—including growth loops, quality of acquisition, engagement, churn, and monetization.
2. Then, identify potential upside based on learnings from within the company and benchmarks from across the industry.
3. Finally, prioritize and make decisions that impact the future.

**The key insight:** Investors aren't just looking at a single growth curve going up and to the right. They're decomposing it into its underlying components to understand if it will sustain, accelerate, or collapse.

**What investors want to understand:**

**Acquisition Mix:** Signups broken down by channels/loops and by time period. They're looking for signals that the dominant channel(s) are proprietary and repeatable. Ideally loops. Low platform risk. A good mix might be 33/33/33—a third organic, plus two loops like viral and SEO.

**Quality of signups:** A startup shouldn't care much about signups—they should care about how well they translate into paying customers or active users. One of the biggest determinants of "quality" is the source of the user. Understand activation rate by channel.

**Red flags investors look for:**
- New channels appearing but aren't sustainable. Especially ad spend that comes and goes, indicating maybe everything's been juiced before the fundraise.
- Spikes in new users from a new channel that's actually low quality. Or doubling down on a low-quality channel just to pump up signup numbers.
- Concentration risk—if all users come from beta users list or Product Hunt, that won't scale.
- Platform risk—if the loop depends on a platform that might change or shrink.

**Cohort retention:** The cohort curves need to flatten. Ideally >20%, so each signup activates into a sticky, active user. If only 5% stick, you'd have to sign up 2 billion users to get 100M MAUs. Not tenable.

**You can project out total company size** by combining TAM with the cohort % you have left after a year (D365 or D730) and then ARPU. This needs to be big enough to have venture scale.

**The forecast:** With deep understanding of both acquisition and engagement loops, investors can build scenarios that model outputs. They get a granular sense of risks. Ultimately this is about a forecast based on quality of acquisition and quality of engagement—not a single number in 2 years.

**Startups aren't spreadsheets.** But understanding the quality of the loops allows for real discussion about what might happen next.
