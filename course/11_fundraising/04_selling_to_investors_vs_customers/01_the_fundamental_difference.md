# The Fundamental Difference

Time and time again, Ross Haleliuk sees companies repeat the same mistake: attempting to sell to their prospect the same way they sell to their investors.

**This is especially common in industries like cybersecurity where the vast majority of market players are startups.**

Security founders must understand the difference between how these two groups make their buying decisions:

**Selling to investors:**

- **Only ~10% of what the investor is buying already exists; 90% (or more) is yet to be built.**
- VCs are buying a vision of where the company could (and hopefully will) be, assuming everything goes well.
- Selling to investors is about excitement, getting their eyes light up, and imagining what is possible tomorrow.

**Selling to enterprise customers:**

- **Over ~90% of what the enterprise customer is buying must exist today; 10% (or less) can be a future vision.**
- Buyers know that startups are inherently risky and unstable. A year or two later, the company may be gone. By agreeing to buy from the startup, the enterprise is already taking a risk.
- CISOs want to know what problems the product will solve for them **today**. Every single founder has an inspiring vision that goes miles beyond what the product is in the present, yet the customer isn't looking to buy that vision—its goal is to solve the problems it deals with today.
- Selling to enterprises is about enablement, support, response times, contract price, product capabilities, and the ability to replace parts of the current (or legacy) stack—other pragmatic matters.

**The mistake:** Using the same pitch for both. Showing investors the vision gets them excited. Showing customers the vision makes them nervous. They need to know what works **right now**, not what might work in two years.
