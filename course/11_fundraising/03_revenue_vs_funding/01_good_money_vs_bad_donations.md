# Good Money vs Bad Donations

Building a business plan to raise money before talking to target customers. Participating in startup competitions where you have 1 chance out of 1000 to win €5000.

Maxime Blondel made those mistakes. He understands why first-time entrepreneurs do the same.

**It's pleasant.** Going to talk to strangers and trying to sell them your product? Much less so.

**Let's be clear: Money from customers is king.**

It's the only way you'll raise funds from good investors (if you want or need to). It's the only way you'll survive. The only way to execute your vision.

**There's only one situation where you focus on building an amazing product without charging customers:** When you're building something technologically complicated that takes a long time to develop.

Agricool is an example. It took time to develop an artificial paradise that copies nature, producing the first strawberries that could be sold.

**But in 99% of cases, focus on money from customers.**

That's it.

Don't get distracted by competitions, grants, or building business plans for investors. Get customers. Get revenue. Then investors will come.
