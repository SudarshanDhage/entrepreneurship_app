# Module: Pitch Decks

A great pitch deck covers key points through visuals and bullet points. It usually has a competition slide, a problem slide, and a solution slide to explain your offering and the market.

Additionally, a business model slide and a team slide (if your business is developed enough to present these) can turn a good deck into a great startup pitch deck.

**Don't forget, a simple pitch deck is a good pitch deck.**
