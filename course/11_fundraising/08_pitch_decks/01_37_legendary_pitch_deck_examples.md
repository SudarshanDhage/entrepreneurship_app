# 37 Legendary Pitch Deck Examples

From behemoths like Facebook and YouTube to superstars like Buffer, together these startups have raised millions of dollars and are now worth billions!

These startup pitch deck examples were created by top brands in tech. At the time, they were all small startups (seed stage companies) looking to raise money or venture capital through potential investors and grow their businesses.

## 1. Facebook Pitch Deck

Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist, and entrepreneur, was the first outside investor in Facebook back in 2004. That's when Mark Zuckerberg first set out to turn his dorm room project into a lasting business. Zuckerberg received $500,000 from Peter Thiel.

Facebook's pitch deck was more of a media kit of sorts. It was containing the company's value proposition, key metrics, and marketing services that were used to sell ads to potential clients.

**Favorite takeaway:** The focus of the startup pitch deck was based on solid numbers such as user engagement, traffic, and growth trajectory.

## 2. TikTok Pitch Deck

TikTok (formerly Musical.ly) revolutionized short-form video content and quickly became one of the world's most downloaded apps. Founded by ByteDance in 2016, TikTok's meteoric rise demonstrated the power of algorithmic content discovery combined with intuitive content creation tools.

Their early pitch deck focused on solving a critical problem: how to lower the barrier to video content creation while maximizing user engagement through an algorithm-first approach. The deck highlighted their unique recommendation engine that personalized content feeds based on user behavior rather than social connections.

**Favorite takeaway:** The deck's brilliant visualization of their "virtuous cycle" – showing how creator tools drive content, which feeds the algorithm, which increases engagement, which attracts more creators. This simple but powerful explanation of their growth flywheel made their potential immediately clear to partners and investors.

## 3. Airbnb Pitch Deck

Airbnb is a platform that allows people to list, find, and rent lodging. This company is one of the greatest startup success stories of our time.

The now famous Airbnb pitch deck has become one of the best pitch decks for inspiring entrepreneurs around the world.

**Favorite takeaway:** The intro. It's all about hooking your audience. You need to describe your business using as few words as possible. Imagine telling a 5-year-old what your business is about. If you can't do that, it's time to put some time into nailing it down.

## 4. YouTube Pitch Deck

YouTube was acquired by Google in 2006 for $1.6 billion. This is YouTube's pitch deck to Sequoia Capital (one of the most established VC investors who's often regarded as one of the industry's best), which was released through a legal proceeding.

**Favorite takeaway:** The company wanted to be the primary outlet for video content, and it succeeded in doing just that. It goes to show that if you know what your product can do, are able to show its potential, and build on the momentum gained through early investments to create that, then you can achieve its potential.

## 5. Dropbox Pitch Deck

Drew Houston was sitting on a bus from Boston to New York, and realized he'd forgotten his USB drive (again). Out of the frustration sparked innovation. What if there was a simpler way to store data that didn't need to be in a physical format?

Founded in 2007 by Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox quickly became a game-changer in cloud storage. The company's core service allows users to store, sync, and share files across devices seamlessly.

Dropbox's 2007 pitch deck, which secured a $1.2 million seed round, stands out for its clarity and engaging approach. The deck's straightforward design, with large text and a clean layout, makes complex information easily digestible.

**Favorite takeaway:** Keep it simple and relatable. Dropbox's pitch deck succeeds by addressing common problems with clear, jargon-free language. For entrepreneurs crafting their own pitch decks, remember that your audience may not be tech experts. Explain your solution in terms anyone can understand and appreciate.

## 6. Uber Pitch Deck

When Uber hit the scene, they fundamentally reimagined urban transportation. Their pitch deck tells this audacious story perfectly. Simple yet impactful, it illustrates the problem of expensive taxis and car services, then introduces Uber as the affordable, tech-driven solution.

They use stark data points to highlight the financial opportunity, a vital touch for potential investors.

**Favorite takeaway:** The deck is clean and minimalist. The flow is easy to follow, and you get a clear idea of what's the problem they're trying to solve, and how they solve it.

## 7. Buffer Pitch Deck

Buffer is a social media scheduling platform that helps you schedule content for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

The almighty startup pitch deck that helped Buffer to raise half a million dollars gained popularity by becoming one of the first pitch decks openly shared online. The founder decided to put it up to help other startups to raise funds.

**Favorite takeaway:** Similar to Facebook, the deck was based on solid numbers from Buffer's users (e.g., 800 users, $150,000 annual revenue run rate, etc.)

## 8. Square Pitch Deck

Square is a company that allows merchants to accept mobile credit card payments via a dongle.

**Favorite takeaway:** Social proof! It doesn't hurt to promote the management team if they've been with Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, PayPal, and more. It shows that your management team's experience is an armor to the company. This detailed startup pitch deck outlines Square's business model and a simple financial model that portrays its annual revenue and five-year growth rate.

## 9. LinkedIn Pitch Deck

Founded in 2002, LinkedIn is the top business-oriented social networking platform.

The company's pitch talks a great deal about company values, the power of networking, and how it's different from other social networks out there.

**Favorite takeaway:** The deck also provides an extensive analogy to showcase to investors what LinkedIn is. For example, it talks about "Web 1.0" vs. "Web 2.0": Alta Vista was "Search 1.0", and Google was "Search 2.0". The deck talks about how LinkedIn is "Networking for Businesses 2.0".

## 10. Mint Pitch Deck

Mint is a personal financial services tool that helps people track their spending and find ways to save money.

This startup pitch deck example was used in a competition and was never used for raising money, but it's still a powerful deck that startups can learn from.

**Favorite takeaway:** This simple deck provides a clear value proposition to customers and investors. The creators of this deck also understood that one of the key concerns of an investor is the exit mechanism of his or her investments. I love how the deck highlights a number of exit strategy options.
