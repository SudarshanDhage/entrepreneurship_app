# Elevator Pitch Templates

Two proven templates you can use immediately: a generic all-purpose template and a sales-specific template.

## Generic Elevator Pitch Template

The following is a standard pitch format that can be applied to almost any situation:

```
My name is <<NAME>>, the CEO of <<COMPANY>>. 
Our company manufactures <<PRODUCT>> for <<TARGET CUSTOMER>> that allows them to <<YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION>>.

Unlike <<OUR COMPETITION>>, we <<PRIMARY COMPETITIVE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE>>.

<<CALL to ACTION>>
```

### Example: Hydrolyzier Water Company

Hi, my name is Bob Smith, and I am the CEO of Hydrolyzier Water Company. We manufacture the Hydrolyzier MaxLite, a commercial-grade water purification system that uses a tri-plane osmotic process that dramatically reduces the content of impurities in drinking water. Unlike competing systems, our patented osmotic process uses one-third of the power of a traditional water purifier while reducing the installation space to half. Our modular construction takes less than 36 hours to install, and best of all its price is less than 60% of similar systems. If you go to our YouTube channel, you can watch a video showing the Hydrolyzier in operation in a remote village in Ghana, West Africa.

## Sales Pitch Template

If you are pitching in a sales situation, use this format:

```
Have you ever <<THE SITUATION THAT THE PROSPECT FACES>>?

<<COMPANY NAME>> manufactures <<PRODUCT LINE>> for <<TARGET MARKET>> so that you can <<PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION / BENEFIT>>.

Unlike <<TRADITIONAL ALTERNATIVES/COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS>>, <<OUR PRODUCT>> is <<COMPETITIVE POINT OF DIFFERENCE>>.

<<CALL TO ACTION>>.
```

### Example: Hydrolyzier Sales Pitch

Have you ever had a situation that required a low power, small footprint, water purification system for a remote settlement? Hydrolyzier Water Company manufactures the Hydrolyzier MaxLite, a commercial-grade water purification system that uses a tri-plane osmotic process that dramatically reduces the content of impurities in drinking water. Unlike competing systems, our patented osmotic process uses one-third of the power of a traditional water purifier while reducing the installation space to half. Our modular construction takes less than 36 hours to install, and best of all its price is less than 60% of similar systems. We have successfully installed the system in many remote communities. They have found it to be easy to install, reliable, and inexpensive to operate. Our most recent installation is in a remote village in Ghana, West Africa which we have documented in a 5 minute YouTube video. May I send you the link?

## Key Elements to Include

Both templates ensure you cover:

1. **Who you are** - Name and title
2. **What you do** - Company and product/service
3. **Who it's for** - Target customer/market
4. **Value proposition** - What problem you solve or benefit you provide
5. **Competitive difference** - Why you're better than alternatives
6. **Call to action** - What you want them to do next

The sales template adds a question hook at the beginning to engage the prospect immediately by identifying with their situation.
