# The Fundamentals of Elevator Pitches

"The first thing, the absolute first thing, that anyone 'buys' from you is your big idea embedded in story form. If people don't 'buy' into the big idea and story, they won't buy anything else."

This insight from Kurian Tharakan, who has coached hundreds of companies and prepared five companies for Dragon's Den (Shark Tank), cuts to the heart of what makes a great pitch.

## What Is an Elevator Pitch?

By definition, an elevator pitch is a quick persuasive speech used to create interest in a project, a concept, or people. It:

- Distills your ideas into the simplest, clearest points of value
- Shows what makes you different
- Instills enough curiosity to make the prospect want to hear more
- Theoretically takes no longer than the time to ride an elevator to the top floor (30 seconds to 2 minutes)

## Why Story Matters Most

Your big idea and story are the beginning of your elevator pitch. Without a compelling story that people can "buy into," you won't get the chance to sell anything else—not your product, not your company, not yourself.

Most pitches fail not because the product or team are poor, but because the pitch structure and story weren't well thought out. But with just a little planning and strategy, this can be corrected.

## Luck Meets Preparation

As is often the case, most opportunities to meet with influential people happen spontaneously and unpredictably:

- The rising screenwriter who collides with a Hollywood producer while waiting in line for a taxi
- The hopeful new employee who finds himself in the elevator with the company CEO

The adage "luck happens when opportunity meets with preparedness" is very true.

## Different Types of Pitches

There are many different types of pitches, which serve different purposes:

- **Elevator pitches** are meant to instill enough intrigue to get the prospect to ask you to tell them more
- They do not have the persuasive horsepower of a full-fledged sales or investor pitch
- Because these purposes are different, they require different lengths of time and stages of delivery

Pitching is a skill, and just like all skills, there are ways to perfect it. Once you understand the principles of a pitch structure, your elevator pitch, sales pitch, boardroom presentation, or investor pitch will improve dramatically.

## Not Just for Investors

These techniques don't just help with investor pitches. They'll help you get what you want from bosses, spouses, customers, and small children.

The principles of persuasion are universal.
