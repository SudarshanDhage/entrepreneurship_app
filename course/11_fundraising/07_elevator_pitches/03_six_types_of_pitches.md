# Six Types of Pitches

Beyond the standard elevator pitch templates, Daniel Pink in his book *To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others* gives us six other types of pitches that serve different purposes and contexts.

## 1. The One-Word Pitch

Can you distill your entire presentation into a single word?

- For Google, it might be "search."
- For an Alfred Hitchcock horror movie, it might be "scream."
- The word "inbound" belongs to Hubspot.
- While "invent" is closely associated with Thomas Edison.

**Example:** For a water purification company, it might be "purified water." (Okay, that's two words, but the principle stands.)

The one-word pitch forces you to identify the single most essential idea or emotion you want to convey.

## 2. The Question Pitch

Ask yourself, "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"

If your presentation's central idea is already understood by your audience, a question pitch may be ideal.

In the 1980 US presidential election campaign between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, Reagan asked a simple question: "Ask yourself, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?'" Most people immediately understood the question and its context. Reagan became the 40th President of the United States.

**Example:** "How can you supply a rural village in Ghana, West Africa with clean drinking water in under 36 hours, and at less than 60% of the cost of other water purification systems?"

Questions engage the audience's thinking and make them participate in the discovery of your idea.

## 3. The Rhyming Pitch

It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

Rhymes are easy to mentally process and remember. Scientific studies have found that rhymes are perceived to be more accurate and believable than non-rhymes when pitching the same concept.

- Pepsodent: "You'll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent!"
- Timex: "It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."

**Example:** For a water purification company, it might be "Get wet" or "A Pure, Clean, Water Stream."

Rhymes make your message stickier and more memorable.

## 4. The Subject Line Pitch

Every email subject line that you write is a pitch inviting the recipient to open it.

Daniel Pink advises that your subject line pitch should offer **utility value, curiosity, and specificity**. However, he cautions that while specificity should be in all subject lines, you should choose to use either utility value or curiosity for any single subject line.

**Examples:**
- Drugstore: "Your prescription is expiring."
- Mortgage Broker: "How Much House Can You Afford?"
- Credit Card Company: "You're missing out on reward points."

**Example:** "How Remote Communities Can Install On-Site Purified Drinking Water Systems in Under 36 hours."

Subject line pitches are your first chance to grab attention—make it count.

## 5. The Twitter Pitch

Can you get your pitch down to 140 characters? Or less?

**Examples for Twitter itself:**
- "Twitter. The only place you get excited when a stranger follows you."
- "Twitter. Get the news before it happens."

**Example:** "Clean Drinking Water for 300 African Villagers in Under 36 hours."

The constraint of character limits forces you to be extremely precise and impactful. If you can't say it in 140 characters, you might not be clear enough about your core message.

## 6. The Pixar Pitch

Animation studio Pixar has produced a string of hits, including Wall-E, Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Incredibles, and many others. Their standard plot structure follows this format:

```
Once upon a time <<INTRODUCE CHARACTER AND CONTEXT>>

Every day, <<ESTABLISH THE WAY THINGS WERE>>.

One day <<INTRODUCE PROBLEM/INCITING INCIDENT>>.

Because of that <<CHALLENGE>>.

Because of that <<SEARCH FOR SOLUTION>>

Until finally <<FINDS SOLUTION>>

Now, <<ESTABLISH THE WAY THINGS ARE BETTER NOW>>
```

### Example: Hydrolyzier

In Africa, village water wells are vital to the sustainability of the rural population. In one community, we counted over 300 people who relied on a single well as their only source of daily drinking water, often walking from miles around to obtain it. Last year, the well was found to be contaminated by waterborne parasites. Hydrolyzier was one of three companies contacted by the regional government to remedy the situation. We were selected to install our new water purification system, the Hydrolyzier MaxLite, primarily due to the speed which we could deploy it (in less than 36 hours), and its cost (less than 60% of its competitors). Today, the people of this village can safely drink from their well again.

The Pixar pitch uses story structure to make your pitch compelling and memorable. Stories have the ability to draw and keep attention, fascinate, intrigue, and engage all our mental and emotional energies.

## When to Use Each Type

- **One-Word:** When you need to capture the essence instantly
- **Question:** When your audience already understands the context
- **Rhyming:** When you want maximum memorability
- **Subject Line:** For email and digital communications
- **Twitter:** When you need extreme brevity and clarity
- **Pixar:** When you have time for a full narrative arc

Each pitch type serves a different purpose. Master them all, and you'll be prepared for any situation.
