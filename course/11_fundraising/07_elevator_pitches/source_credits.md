- **Key Concepts:** Elevator pitches, pitch templates, storytelling in pitches, pitch types (one-word, question, rhyming, subject line, Twitter, Pixar), pitch amplifiers, psychological persuasion tactics, Dragon's Den, Shark Tank
- **Key Insight:** "The first thing, the absolute first thing, that anyone 'buys' from you is your big idea embedded in story form." Most pitches fail not because the product or team are poor, but because the pitch structure and story weren't well thought out. Elevator pitches should be 30 seconds to 2 minutes, distilling ideas into simplest points of value and instilling curiosity. Six types of pitches beyond standard templates: one-word, question, rhyming, subject line, Twitter, and Pixar pitches. Pitch amplifiers include shock/intrigue, metaphor, clarity, emotional appeal, tangible demonstration, risk reduction, authority, scarcity, repetition, contrast, story, and time. Based on experience coaching hundreds of companies and preparing five companies for Dragon's Den/Shark Tank pitches.
