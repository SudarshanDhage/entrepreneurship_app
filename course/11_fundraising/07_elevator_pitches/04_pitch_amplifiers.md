# Pitch Amplifiers

If you are in a full-fledged pitch like those on Dragon's Den or Shark Tank, these pitch amplifiers will come in very handy. Beyond profiling a great product or service, your pitch should also contain these psychological persuasion tactics.

## Shock, Fascination, or Intrigue

The Dragons' minds are wandering during your entrance. Their brains are actively searching for WHY they should care. Give them a simple statement that startles them into rapt attention.

**Weak opening:**
"Our device is called the Hydrolyzier, and it uses a tri-plane osmotic process that dramatically reduces the content of impurities in drinking water."

**Strong opening:**
"Water is life, yet 768 million people do not have access to safe, clean drinking water, and 2.5 billion people live without proper sanitation. When water is unsafe and sanitation non-existent, water can kill." (Unicef Clean Water Campaign)

The second statement allows a fluid transition into a description of your product WITH the Dragons' full attention.

## Metaphor

Because people absorb new information by relating it to an existing reference point they understand, create a metaphor that allows them to associate, compare, and draw relations easily.

When Gene Roddenberry was pitching the original Star Trek series to NBC in 1964, the concept of a racially mixed crew with women and aliens on the bridge travelling to distant planets was so foreign that it was initially dismissed. To sell the idea, Roddenberry used the metaphor of a "space western." Because western movies and TV shows were something everyone was familiar with, this bought him the time and funding to develop not just one, but two pilots for the popular series.

**Example:** "Hydrolyzier: We are the IKEA of Commercial Water Plants."

This metaphor immediately conveys low cost, small size, and modular/rapid deployment capability.

## Clarity

As a minimum, the elevator pitch has to have clarity on the attributes of:

- The primary problem the product solves
- The way it solves it
- Alternatives to the product, but emphasizing how you are better
- How big the market is
- The cost of the solution
- The price you can charge
- How much investment capital you need and for what purpose
- What the Dragons will receive for their money

Clarity eliminates confusion and hesitation. When investors understand exactly what they're getting, they can make decisions faster.

## Emotional Appeal

To get people moving fast and with purpose, you must infuse your pitch with emotion. Confidence, fear, anger, amazement, joy, indignation, love, disgust, envy, or dozens of other emotions can energize your pitch. Choose the ones most relevant to the story you are telling.

Emotion drives action. Logic justifies it, but emotion is what makes people care enough to act.

## Tangible Demonstration

Nothing shows people what your product can do better than a physical demonstration. Imagination and understanding are stoked further when something is taken in hand. Get the audience involved in a demo.

Seeing is believing. A demo makes abstract concepts concrete.

## Risk Reduction

Every new investment involves risk. Show the Dragons you understand what the risks are, and how you will quell them.

**Nothing makes investment risk in a startup go away faster than showing you have sales.** Show the Dragons your sales pipeline to get a deal done fast.

Addressing risk head-on shows maturity and preparation. Having sales shows validation.

## Authority

Authority commands attention, respect, and intrigue. Show the Dragons you are an authority on the market, its pain, your solution, and the competitive alternatives.

Authority can come in many forms but always includes the primary elements of:
- **Knowledge** - Deep understanding of the domain
- **Experience** - Real-world practice and results
- **Credentials** - Relevant qualifications or recognition
- **Public recognition** - Media, awards, testimonials

Demonstrate all four in the pitch.

## Scarcity

If it's valuable, it's probably scarce. Show the Dragons that the opportunity to invest is (truthfully) fleeting.

Common reasons why:
- Sales are coming in so fast you will soon be able to self-fund out of cash-flow
- Because sales are increasing, the valuation they can invest at will continue to rise the longer they wait
- You have another strategic partner that has indicated they want to invest in you

Scarcity creates urgency. But be honest—don't manufacture false scarcity.

## Repetition

Repetition drives the message deeper. What is the central unifying message of your elevator speech? Repeat it three times in the presentation.

For the UNICEF Clean Water Campaign, it might be "Water is life."

Repetition ensures your core message is remembered even if other details are forgotten.

## Contrast

Something is "hot" only in relation to something that is "cold." The Dragons' brains are actively looking for a contrast to help them analyze and categorize the data for a decision.

In the Hydrolyzier example, the easiest way to employ contrast is to show a before and after comparison of the water. Dirty, polluted water before filtration, clean, clear water after.

Contrast makes differences clear and decisions easier.

## Story

Now, wrap it all up in a story. Humans have been gathering in groups to tell stories for millennia. Stories have the ability to draw and keep attention, fascinate, intrigue, and engage all our mental and emotional energies.

Great brands are about great stories. Create a powerful narrative to tell.

## Time

Finally, keep the pitch short, just long enough to get all of the above out, but no longer.

Respect your audience's time. A long pitch doesn't mean a better pitch—it usually means you haven't distilled your message enough.

## Putting It All Together

By using these structures, and embedding these psychological persuasion tactics in your pitch, you will have a dramatically improved chance of making a memorable impact!

The best pitches don't just inform—they engage, persuade, and inspire action. Master these amplifiers, and your pitch will do just that.
