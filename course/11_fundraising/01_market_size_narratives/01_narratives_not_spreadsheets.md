# Narratives, Not Spreadsheets

"Anyone who has pitched VCs knows they are obsessed with market size."

Chris Dixon states the obvious. Because it's true. And it matters.

"If you can't make the case that you're addressing a possible billion dollar market, you'll have difficulty getting VCs to invest."

Smaller investors like angels and seed funds are more flexible—they'll often invest when the market is "only" ~$100M. But VCs? They need big markets. Perfectly rational, since VC returns tend to be driven by a few big hits in big markets.

**But here's the critical part:** "If you are arguing market size with a VC using a spreadsheet, you've already lost the debate."

For early-stage companies, you should never rely on quantitative analysis to estimate market size. Venture-style startups are bets on broad, secular trends. Good VCs understand this.

So what do they want to see?

**A strongly argued narrative** that explains the market has or will attain the required size. They want related facts that support the narrative. But they don't want wild guesses presented as facts.

Venture capitalists hate hockey stick curves based on unrealistic assumptions. They've seen too many of those. But they'll listen to a compelling story about why your market will be massive—if you can back it up with real insights and trends.

"Startups that fill white spaces [areas where there is latent demand without supply] aren't usually world-changing companies, but they often have solid exits."

So think in narratives. Think in trends. Think in stories about how the world is changing. Not in spreadsheet cells.
