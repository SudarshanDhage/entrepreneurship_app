# Builders vs Extractors

"There are two kinds of investors: Ron Conways who try to create value by finding good people and helping them create something great, and others, who want a piece of someone else's things. The builders and the extractors. Avoid the extractors."

That's how Chris Dixon puts it. Simple. Clear. Important.

"Founders too often view raising capital as a transaction, when it is actually a very deep relationship. They think of money as money, when there is actually smart money, dumb money, high-integrity money, and low-integrity money."

**In the United States, money is not the scarce resource in venture capital.** The scarce resource is fundable startups.

The outcome for any startup will increasingly be determined by access to networks of people and resources. If you have a choice between (1) just money and (2) money plus access to these networks—choose the latter.

Because startups compete in an "Extremistan" environment—winner-take-all or winner-take-most-all. Even the smallest advantage can tip the balance.

Some founders might want a cheerleader. But smart entrepreneurs want someone who can directly help with:
- Recruiting
- Pricing problems
- Distribution challenges
- Strategic decisions

**The lesson:** When you're raising money, you're not just raising money. You're choosing a partner. Choose someone who builds, not someone who extracts.

Choose someone who creates value, not someone who just wants a piece of yours.
