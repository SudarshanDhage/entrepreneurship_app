# Founder-VC Tension

"VCs have a portfolio, and they want to have big wins. They'd rather have a few more lottery tickets... while for the entrepreneurs, it's their whole life."

That's the tension. And Chris Dixon has been on both sides—founder and VC. He gets it.

Here's the scenario: You raised five million bucks. You have a fifty million dollar offer. As an entrepreneur, you think: "I make whatever millions of dollars. I'll be able to start another company."

But the VCs invested billions of dollars across their portfolio. They need bigger wins. That's where tension comes.

**Why this happens:** Venture capitalists employ diversification strategies. They're managing portfolios, not single companies. But for founders? It's everything.

Warren Buffett explained the investor's view: Most venture capitalists employ wide diversification. They want lots of action because probabilities favor them, but they won't accept single huge bets.

**But founders?** If you're concentrating your investments—if your net worth is measured in, say, the success of this one company—your risk profile is completely different.

Fred Wilson has written thoughtfully on this: "Providing some founder liquidity, at the appropriate time, will incentivize the founders to have a longer term focus and that will result in exits at much larger valuations because, contrary to popular belief, founders drive the timing of exit way more than VCs do."

The wisest outcome depends on facts and circumstances. There's no connect-the-dots formula that works in all cases.

But the important point Dixon raises: **This is an issue.** It can create tension. And it needs to be dealt with intelligently.

Founders are smarter and better informed than ever. They want VCs who are empathetic and thoughtful—who understand the human side, not just the portfolio math.
