# Why Aren't You Starting Today?

Once you've found a problem you're passionate about in a promising market, **start as fast as possible.**

The best entrepreneurs have a real ability to reduce timelines. At the beginning, set goals you can reach in **1 day, or 1 week maximum.**

Blondel has seen too many young entrepreneurs theorize, make plans, write business plans for months—before talking to any potential targets. Before confronting their idea with the market.

**At The Family, among all factors (background of founders, number of founders...), the only one that works is the speed of decision-making and iterations. Basically, how fast you execute.**

At the beginning of your journey, you always have someone to meet, interview, and/or convince. As fast as possible.

**Examples:**

- **Physical product like FEMPO's menstrual panties?** Start selling via landing page or crowdfunding while meeting factories.
- **Future of agriculture like Agricool?** Go convince investors. You'll need a lot of money.
- **Marketplace like StarOfService?** Create a showcase website (Wix/Wordpress), request form (Typeform), database (Spreadsheet). Connect by hand via email. Start.
- **Mobile app like Heetch?** Print a big sign. Post yourself in front of nightclubs. Find customers to take home while developing the app.
- **New media company?** Start like My Little Paris—with a newsletter.
- **Community?** Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups, or live events as MVP.
- **Uber of road transport?** Take a day. Design a model in Photoshop. Make appointment with potential client. Show them the model. Ask for changes that would make them sign a contract. **Sign the contract.** Now you have 2 months to develop and honor it.

**That technique reduces timelines.** Humans can produce in 2 months what we'd usually do in 6, so long as we have the sword hanging over our head.

Hello, Fretlink. That's "Fake it til you make it."

**The essence of entrepreneurship lies in execution, not theory.**
