- **Date:** April 2017 (2016 Letter to Shareholders)
- **Key Concepts:** Day 1, Day 2, customer obsession, organizational decline, proxies, process, decision making, execution speed, external trends, long-term thinking, organizational culture
- **Key Insight:** How to fend off "Day 2" - which is stasis, followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating painful decline, followed by death. Always Day 1. Four essentials for Day 1 defense: (1) True customer obsession - customers always beautifully dissatisfied even when happy, desire to delight drives invention (Prime example), requires experiment patiently/accept failures/plant seeds/protect saplings/double down on delight, customer-obsessed culture creates conditions for all that. (2) Resist proxies - as companies grow, tendency to manage to proxies (dangerous, subtle, very Day 2). Process as proxy: good process serves you to serve customers, but process can become the thing, stop looking at outcomes just doing process right, junior leaders defend bad outcomes with "we followed process", experienced leaders investigate/improve process, ask: do we own process or does process own us? Market research as proxy: surveys can become proxies for customers (dangerous when inventing/designing), misleading metrics like "55% satisfied up from 47%", good inventors/designers deeply understand customers (study anecdotes not just averages, live with design), must have vision and love offering, then research helps find blind spots, remarkable experience starts with heart/intuition/curiosity/play/guts/taste (not in surveys). (3) Embrace external trends - outside world pushes to Day 2 if won't/can't embrace trends quickly, fighting trends = fighting future, embrace them = tailwind, trends obvious but hard for large orgs to embrace (e.g., machine learning/AI - shift from automating clear rules to tasks where describing precise rules harder), Amazon examples: Prime Air drones, Amazon Go, Alexa (visible) plus demand forecasting/search ranking/recommendations/fraud detection/translations (beneath surface, quietly improving core operations), AWS lowering barriers so all sizes can take advantage. (4) High-velocity decision making - Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions slowly, need both quality and speed, easy for startups challenging for large orgs. Four principles: (a) Never one-size-fits-all - many decisions reversible (two-way doors), use lightweight process, so what if wrong? (b) 70% information rule - most decisions with 70% of information wish had (not 90%), need good at recognizing/correcting bad decisions quickly, being wrong less costly than slow if good at course correction. (c) Disagree and commit - saves time, if conviction without consensus say "disagree and commit?", applies both ways (bosses should do too), example: Amazon Studios original Bezos disagreed but committed, much faster than if team had to convince, genuine disagreement/candid expression/quick sincere commitment. (d) Recognize misalignment early/escalate immediately - teams sometimes have different objectives/fundamental views, deep misalignment can't be resolved by discussion/meetings, default resolution without escalation is exhaustion (whoever has stamina wins), example: third-party sellers competing on own product pages, "worn me down" awful process (slow/de-energizing), go for quick escalation. Diagnostic questions: settled for decision quality or mindful of velocity too? Are trends tailwinds? Falling prey to proxies or do they serve you? Delighting customers? Goal: scope/capabilities of large company with spirit/heart of small one, but must choose it. 1997 letter principles: long-term focus (shareholder value over long term, market leadership), make investment decisions for long-term leadership not short-term profitability, measure analytically/jettison failures/step up what works, bold investment decisions (some pay off some don't), cash flows over GAAP accounting, share strategic thought processes, spend wisely/maintain lean culture, balance growth with profitability, focus on hiring/retaining versatile talented employees (compensation weighted to stock options). Key takeaways: Day 2 is death (stasis→irrelevance→decline→death, always Day 1), true customer obsession (customers beautifully dissatisfied, drives invention), resist proxies (process/research become proxies, ask who owns what), understand customers deeply (anecdotes not averages), embrace trends (fighting trends = fighting future), high-velocity decisions (quality + speed), no one-size-fits-all (reversible = lightweight), 70% information rule, disagree and commit (both ways), escalate misalignment early, long-term focus, maintain lean culture.
