# Avoiding Day 2: Jeff Bezos's Letter to Shareholders

"Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1." How to fend off Day 2 and maintain the vitality of Day 1 even inside a large organization.

## What is Day 2?

**The question:** "Jeff, what does Day 2 look like?"

**The answer:** "Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1."

**The timeframe:** To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion. An established company might harvest Day 2 for decades, but the final result would still come.

**The challenge:** How do you fend off Day 2? What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization?

**The answer isn't simple:** Such a question can't have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. Here's a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.

## True Customer Obsession

**There are many ways to center a business:** You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more.

**But customer obsession is most protective:** But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.

**The big advantage:** There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here's the big one: **customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great.** Even when they don't yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf.

**The Prime example:** No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples.

**What it requires:** Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen.

## Resist Proxies

**The danger of proxies:** As companies get larger and more complex, there's a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it's dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2.

### Process as Proxy

**The problem:** A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you're not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want.

**The symptoms:** You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you're doing the process right. Gulp. It's not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, "Well, we followed the process." A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process.

**The principle:** The process is not the thing. It's always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? In a Day 2 company, you might find it's the second.

### Market Research as Proxy

**Another example:** Market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – something that's especially dangerous when you're inventing and designing products.

**The misleading metrics:** "Fifty-five percent of beta testers report being satisfied with this feature. That is up from 47% in the first survey." That's hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead.

**Understanding vs. metrics:** Good inventors and designers deeply understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you'll find on surveys. They live with the design.

**When proxies help:** I'm not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering. Then, beta testing and research can help you find your blind spots.

**Where experience comes from:** A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste. You won't find any of it in a survey.

## Embrace External Trends

**The threat:** The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won't or can't embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you're probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.

**They're obvious but hard to adopt:** These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace.

**The current trend:** We're in the middle of an obvious one right now: machine learning and artificial intelligence.

**The shift:** Over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe with clear rules and algorithms. Modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder.

**Amazon's application:** At Amazon, we've been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now. Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa, our cloud-based AI assistant.

**But much happens beneath the surface:** But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type – quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.

**Making it accessible:** Inside AWS, we're excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and AI so organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques.

## High-Velocity Decision Making

**The Day 2 problem:** Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions, but they make high-quality decisions slowly. To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, high-velocity decisions.

**The challenge:** Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations. The senior team at Amazon is determined to keep our decision-making velocity high. Speed matters in business – plus a high-velocity decision making environment is more fun too.

### 1. Never Use One-Size-Fits-All

**First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process.** Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you're wrong?

### 2. 70% of the Information

**Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had.** If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow.

**Plus, course correction:** Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you're good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.

### 3. Disagree and Commit

**Third, use the phrase "disagree and commit."** This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there's no consensus, it's helpful to say, "Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?" By the time you're at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you'll probably get a quick yes.

**This isn't one way:** This isn't one way. If you're the boss, you should do this too. I disagree and commit all the time.

**The example:** We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren't that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with "I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we've ever made."

**The speed benefit:** Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment.

**What this is not:** Note what this example is not: it's not me thinking to myself "well, these guys are wrong and missing the point, but this isn't worth me chasing." It's a genuine disagreement of opinion, a candid expression of my view, a chance for the team to weigh my view, and a quick, sincere commitment to go their way.

### 4. Recognize True Misalignment Early

**Fourth, recognize true misalignment issues early and escalate them immediately.** Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment.

**The default resolution:** Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision.

**The Amazon example:** I've seen many examples of sincere misalignment at Amazon over the years. When we decided to invite third party sellers to compete directly against us on our own product detail pages – that was a big one. Many smart, well-intentioned Amazonians were simply not at all aligned with the direction. The big decision set up hundreds of smaller decisions, many of which needed to be escalated to the senior team.

**Avoid exhaustion:** "You've worn me down" is an awful decision-making process. It's slow and de-energizing. Go for quick escalation instead – it's better.

## The Questions to Ask

**The diagnostic questions:**
- Have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too?
- Are the world's trends tailwinds for you?
- Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you?
- And most important of all, are you delighting customers?

**The goal:** We can have the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. But we have to choose it.

## The 1997 Letter: It's All About the Long Term

**The foundation:** The 1997 letter remains Day 1. Here are the fundamental principles:

**Long-term focus:** We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.

**The management approach:**
- We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.
- We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.
- We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best.
- We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages.
- When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we'll take the cash flows.
- We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices.
- We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture.
- We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management.
- We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Day 2 is death** - Stasis → irrelevance → decline → death. Always Day 1.

2. **True customer obsession** - Customers are always beautifully dissatisfied. This drives invention.

3. **Resist proxies** - Process and metrics become proxies. Ask: do we own the process or does it own us?

4. **Understand customers deeply** - Good inventors study anecdotes, not just averages. Experience comes from heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste.

5. **Embrace external trends** - If you fight them, you're fighting the future. Embrace them for a tailwind.

6. **High-velocity decision making** - Day 2 companies make good decisions slowly. Need both quality and speed.

7. **No one-size-fits-all** - Reversible decisions use lightweight process.

8. **70% information rule** - Most decisions should be made with 70% of desired information, not 90%.

9. **Disagree and commit** - Saves time. Apply both ways - bosses should do it too.

10. **Escalate misalignment early** - Don't let exhaustion be the resolution mechanism.

11. **Long-term focus** - Make decisions for long-term market leadership, not short-term profitability.

12. **Maintain lean culture** - Even at scale, maintain startup energy and heart.
