# Pitch Yourself, Not Your Idea

"There is a widespread myth that the most important part of building a great company is coming up with a great idea."

Chris Dixon cuts straight to it. The myth is pervasive. And it's wrong.

**Here's what VCs actually want to see:** Can you execute?

That's why they tell you to "come back when you have a demo." They're not wondering whether your product can be built. They're wondering whether **YOU** can build it.

"What you should really be focused on when pitching your early stage startup is pitching yourself and your team. Of course a great way to show you can build stuff is to build a prototype of the product you are raising money for."

Great ideas matter. But the ability of a team to execute? That's a more important consideration than a clever idea.

Most people have said "I thought of that idea first" when they see a new business. But the best idea in the world without a team to make it happen? Won't amount to a hill of beans.

**The best evidence you can create software?** Actually creating software.  
**The best evidence a team can execute?** Actually executing on something.

As the old proverb goes: The proof of the pudding is in the eating.

So stop polishing your pitch deck. Stop perfecting your idea. Build something. Even if it's rough. Even if it's just a prototype. Build it.

That's what matters.
