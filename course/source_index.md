- **Key Insight:** "Do any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it?" Until that's a "yes", focus on this instead of growth targets.

### What We Look for in Founders

- **Source:** Paul Graham's Essays
- **Author:** Paul Graham
- **URL:** https://www.paulgraham.com/founders.html
- **Date:** October 2010 (written for Forbes)
- **Featured:** Paul Graham
- **Key Concepts:** Founder qualities, determination (most important, more than intelligence), flexibility (like a running back), imagination (ideas with right level of craziness), naughtiness (piratical gleam, breaking unimportant rules), friendship (strong co-founder relationships), threshold intelligence, obstacles, demoralization, pivoting, Airbnb example, Sam Altman hacking question, Justin.tv co-founders
- **Key Insight:** Determination matters more than intelligence. Beyond a threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination. The five qualities: Determination, Flexibility, Imagination, Naughtiness, Friendship.
- **Examples:** Bill Clerico (WePay), Daniel Gross (Greplin - flexibility), Airbnb (too crazy idea that worked), Sam Altman (hacking question), Emmett Shear and Justin Kan (Justin.tv - friendship since second grade)

- **URL:** https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/entrepreneurs/effective-founders-project/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Google for Startups, research from Harvard, Stanford, and University of Chicago
- **Key Concepts:** People problems cause 55% of startup failures, treat people like volunteers, protect team from distractions, minimize micromanagement, invite disagreement, preserve interpersonal equity, keep pace with expertise, overcome discouragement, Dunning-Kruger effect, founder confidence paradox, closure rituals, violated expectations, co-founder conflict, technical expertise
- **Key Insight:** 55% of startups fail because of people problems. Seven key findings from studying 900+ founders, CEOs, and CTOs across 40+ countries. The most effective founders are less confident than the least effective—because they're aware of what they don't know.
- **Statistics:** 55% startup failure due to people problems, 900+ founders studied, 40+ countries, 93% of effective founders have technical expertise

- **Author:** Chris Dixon

- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Chris Dixon
- **Key Concepts:** Hill climbing algorithm, local maximum, career decisions, near-term vs long-term rewards, behavioral economics, ambitious people trap, meandering early career, exploring different paths, wrong hill metaphor
- **Key Insight:** People systematically overvalue near-term rewards over long-term rewards, especially ambitious people. When you know you want to be on a different hill (career path), don't waste time climbing the current one—even if the next step up looks attractive.
- **Examples:** Investment banker wanting to join tech startup, staying for raise/promotion despite knowing long-term goal is elsewhere

### Founder Mode

- **Source:** Paul Graham's Essays
- **Author:** Paul Graham
- **URL:** https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html
- **Date:** September 2024
- **Featured:** Paul Graham, Brian Chesky (Airbnb), Steve Jobs (Apple), Ron Conway
- **Key Concepts:** Founder mode vs manager mode, scaling startups, conventional management advice, "hire good people and give them room", professional managers vs founders, skip-level meetings, gaslighting founders, modular design management, Steve Jobs annual retreats, delegation boundaries, Airbnb free cash flow margin
- **Key Insight:** Two different ways to run companies: founder mode vs manager mode. Conventional advice ("hire good people and give them room") is for professional managers, not founders. Scaling doesn't have to mean switching to manager mode. Founders feel gaslit by conventional advice and employees. Skip-level engagement will be normal in founder mode. More complex than manager mode but works better.
- **Examples:** Brian Chesky (Airbnb) following conventional advice led to disastrous results, then studied Steve Jobs and improved; Steve Jobs annual retreats for 100 most important people (not highest on org chart); many successful YC founders had same experience
- **Used In:**
  - Chapter 8: Building Teams (CEO Excellence) - Founder Mode

### Coaching Founder Mode

- **Source:** SVPG (Silicon Valley Product Group)
- **Author:** Marty Cagan
- **URL:** https://www.svpg.com/coaching-founder-mode/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Marty Cagan, Paul Graham, Steve Jobs, Dave Packard, Amazon leadership principles
- **Key Concepts:** Coaching founders vs replacing them, delegator vs micromanager vs founder mode, better management not less management, empowerment vs delegation confusion, John Sculley (professional manager example), Steve Jobs (founder mode example), HP Management By Wandering Around (MBWA), Management By Objectives (MBO), Amazon Dive Deep principle, coaching founder mode in all product leaders, founder mode doesn't travel well, developing founder mode for non-founders, CPO working with founder CEO, product sense, "lead with context not control" (Netflix)
- **Key Insight:** Better management, not less management. Empowered organizations require better management—immersing in details, asking questions, coaching, connecting dots, evangelizing vision. Founder Mode is neither delegation nor micromanagement—it's deep engagement that provides context and coaching, enabling teams to innovate. Key to scale is strong founder-mode leaders developing other founder-mode leaders.
- **Examples:** Dave Packard (HP) talking to individual contributor engineer, HP leadership principles (MBWA, MBO, coaching), Amazon Dive Deep, Apple's broad and deep bench of leaders after Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Twitter (founder mode doesn't travel well), John Sculley vs Steve Jobs

### Startup Idea Checklist

- **Source:** defmacro.org
- **Author:** defmacro
- **URL:** https://defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** defmacro
- **Key Concepts:** Startup idea evaluation, product questions (users, dissatisfaction, what you're building), growth questions (market size, early adopters, first 10 customers, playbook, capital), strategy questions (why now, 25-year milestone, moat), meaning questions (impact, personal commitment, failure), character limits for clarity, using for development vs filtering
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive checklist covering Product, Growth, Strategy, and Meaning. Use for development and filtering, but be careful in early stages—good ideas are easy to kill. Inspired by YC application, Amazon's internal press release, Sequoia's Writing a Business Plan.
- **Quotes/References:** Don Valentine ("Who cares?"), @benedictevans (user problems), @BrianNorgard (no one cares about your product), Peter Drucker (designed for vs at customer), @sama (easy to say startups are bad), George Orwell (whoever is winning seems invincible)

### What is First Principles Thinking?

- **Source:** Farnam Street
- **URL:** https://fs.blog/first-principles/
- **Featured:** Richard Feynman, Wittgenstein, Carl Sagan, Elon Musk (SpaceX), Jonah Peretti (BuzzFeed), Derek Sivers (CD Baby), Harrington Emerson
- **Key Concepts:** First principles thinking, reasoning from first principles, breaking down complex problems, separating truth from assumptions, Socratic questioning (6-step process), Five Whys technique, moving from incremental to possible, limiting beliefs, examples from SpaceX (rocket materials, battery packs), BuzzFeed (distribution-first), CD Baby (happy customers)
- **Key Insight:** First principles thinking is breaking down complicated problems by separating what we know is absolutely true from anything that is an assumption. It allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and see what is possible. The real power is moving away from incremental improvement and into possibility. Not easy—requires challenging the status quo. Offers competitive advantage because it's not widely practiced.
- **Examples:** Elon Musk analyzing rocket materials (2% of cost), battery packs ($80/kWh materials vs $600/kWh finished), BuzzFeed focusing on shareability over SEO, Derek Sivers focusing on happy customers over fancy infrastructure

### Writing to Think

- **Source:** Herbert Lui Blog
- **Author:** Herbert Lui
- **URL:** https://herbertlui.net/dont-think-to-write-write-to-think/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Herbert Lui
- **Key Concepts:** Writing as thinking process (not artifact), writing as planning and final product, crummy first drafts (wastewater), writing for fun without fear of looking stupid, writing as sketching, writing to collaborate, creative doing drives creative thinking, slowing thinking down for deeper thought
- **Key Insight:** Writing IS thinking—it's not just the artifact of thinking, it's the actual thinking process. Writing is both the planning process and the final product. All writing starts as "wastewater" (crummy first drafts). Just put words on the page; with enough words, something interesting will emerge. Creative thinking comes from creative doing. Writing helps slow thinking down, allowing deeper, more thorough thought.
- **Practical Application:** Start with lame sentences, elaborate, eventually string together sentences that make sense. Satisfaction comes from accurate expression, not measuring up to other writers' standards. Daily writing keeps you practiced and lean, prevents creative blocks, brings fulfillment, helps generate ideas and think more clearly.
- **Quotes/References:** Paolo Belardi "Why Architects Still Draw" (writing is like architectural sketching), "Chance IV is the kind of luck that develops during a probing action which has a distinctive personal flavor"

### The Creativity Faucet

- **Source:** Julian.com
- **Author:** Julian Shapiro
- **URL:** https://www.julian.com/blog/creativity-faucet
- **Featured:** Ed Sheeran, Neil Gaiman, John Mayer, Paul Simon, Mozart, Edison
- **Key Concepts:** Creativity faucet metaphor, emptying wastewater first, bad ideas as clichés, pattern-matching improvement, relentless juxtaposition, combining unrelated elements, don't recreate what you love, pursue what you wish others would have made, originality vs resonance, storytelling engagement formula (Novelty × Resonance)
- **Key Insight:** Visualize creativity as a backed-up pipe of water. The first mile is packed with wastewater that must be emptied before clear water arrives. At the beginning of a creative session, see through every bad idea. Once you've generated enough bad output, your mind identifies what caused the badness and avoids it. It's easier to look at something bad and intuit how to make it better than to make something good from scratch. World-class creators (Ed Sheeran, Neil Gaiman, John Mayer) share this exact process.
- **The Cycle:** Work starts as weak imitation → identify what makes it weak → iterate until original. Mozart had 600 compositions, Edison had 1093 patents—only a few remembered.
- **Relentless Juxtaposition:** Combine unrelated elements from different approaches. Don't recreate what you love—pursue what you wish others would have made by now. Technique: Watch a film you love, stop halfway, ask "What's the most mind-blowing second half?" 
- **Originality vs Resonance:** Don't let pursuit of originality freeze the process. Resonance (relatable storytelling that takes over viewer's mind) is more important than originality. Gladiator and Shawshank Redemption tell clichéd stories but resonate because they express truth so well.
- **Formula:** Storytelling engagement = Novelty × Resonance. The combination of both leads to breakthrough stories.

### Why VC Funding Destroys Companies

- **Source:** Oliver Eidel's Blog
- **Author:** Oliver Eidel
- **URL:** https://blog.oliver-eidel.de/posts/dont-take-vc-funding/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Oliver Eidel, Peter Drucker
- **Key Concepts:** VC funding as confession of failure, selling company parts (not receiving cash), building to sell vs building to keep, profitability feedback loop, second-order effects (hiring pressure, spending time on fundraising, focusing on large markets, customer acquisition over satisfaction, profitability takes back seat), arbitrary metrics, political discussions, bootstrapping alternatives, consulting as starting point
- **Key Insight:** VC funding is not a success—it's a confession that you haven't figured out how to make your company profitable. When you "receive" VC funding, you're actually selling a part of your company. Once you take it, your company's objective fundamentally changes: you're no longer building your company the way you like it. You're building to sell. The feedback loop of profitability is the most important feedback loop any business can have. Once you lose that loop, priorities become arbitrary, people work on random things, and discussions become political. Most companies don't need VC funding—they can bootstrap through consulting or other means.
- **Second-Order Effects:** Have to hire lots of people (company with 10 employees not valuable enough), spend 25-50% of time chasing next investors, focus on large markets (niche won't do), customer acquisition more important than satisfaction, profitability takes back seat (insane purchases, building internal tooling instead of products, arbitrary priorities)
- **Alternatives:** Most companies can bootstrap. Start with consulting, learn the industry, save money, hire first employee, build product, sell to consulting customers. Most product-based businesses can be "projectified" to consulting.

- **URL:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31930935
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Multiple HN commenters sharing practical advice
- **Key Concepts:** Talk to customers before building, "Why are you building something if you haven't talked to your customers?", building in isolation vs. talking first, common objections to talking to customers, finding early adopters, Reddit, Hacker News, LinkedIn Lead Gen forms, conferences, content marketing, app stores, personal networks, snowball method, Product Hunt, IndieHackers, Twitter, YouTube
- **Key Insight:** The moment you try to go to market is when you realize your IPO probably isn't happening soon. Many founders spend months building a solution to a problem they think needs solving, then seek users—rarely successful. Better: Talk to people, listen to what they need, see opportunity in what they're asking for, build incrementally while letting them use it. Only invest time when there's positive signal people will pay.
- **Common Objections Addressed:** "It's a secret" (talk about problems not solutions), "Customers won't get it without MVP" (figure out problems first), "Revealing idea reduces impulse" (actually helps commit to release early), "Customers will ask for features" (that's demand)
- **Practical Tactics:** Reddit (find communities hacking existing products), LinkedIn ads ($25-50 per meeting), conferences/meetups, personal network snowball, content marketing/SEO, app stores, creative tactics (WiFi hotspot name), side projects as marketing

- **URL:** https://www.atlassian.com/blog/strategy/flywheel-effect-10-lessons
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Cameron Deatsch, Jim Collins (Good to Great book)
- **Key Concepts:** Flywheel effect, small wins accumulating into momentum, Jim Collins' flywheel model, three components (Attract, Engage, Delight), reducing friction, self-serve purchase flow, customers as best salespeople, products should be bought not sold, low-touch highly automated GTM, 15% revenue on GTM, 10 lessons from a decade of experience
- **Key Insight:** The flywheel effect occurs when small wins accumulate over time, creating momentum that keeps your business growing. Once you get a flywheel going, it takes relatively little effort to keep it spinning or make it spin faster. Flywheels attract and engage customers 24 hours a day—they're literally working while you sleep. Your customers are your best salespeople. Reducing friction is key. Products should be bought, not sold.
- **10 Lessons:** (1) Just let them buy - optimize for self-service, (2) Price for volume and consistency - same price for everyone, (3) Treat human interaction as a bug - remove friction, (4) Make a lot of friends - channel partners and integrations, (5) Apply diverse forces - ecosystem of add-ons, (6) Community programs - turn users into fans, (7) Don't fall into enterprise trap - avoid losing volume, (8) Think global, beware of local - don't break flywheel in each market, (9) Active users trump everything - usage best indicator, (10) Reinforce with company values
- **Results:** Atlassian's GTM machine runs on just 15% of revenue, allowing more investment in product improvements. The journey is long and full of difficult trade-offs, but it's the key to unlocking exponential growth.
- **Caveats:** Doesn't work well for custom-built or very expensive products. Making things "easy" is brutally difficult.

### What to Do When Growth Stalls

- **Source:** Andrew Chen Blog
- **Author:** Andrew Chen (Partner at Andreessen Horowitz)
- **URL:** https://andrewchen.com/growth-stalls/
- **Featured:** Andrew Chen, @bokardo (Next Feature Fallacy)
- **Key Concepts:** Growth stall diagnosis, crisis arrives slowly then all at once, churn catching up with acquisition, retention as baseline assessment, admitting people don't want your product, positioning against existing categories, activation vs retention, network effects (smile curve), next feature fallacy, top of funnel problems, repeatable growth strategies vs lightning strikes, growth loops (viral, UGC SEO), polishing UX flows for growth, signup flows, invite flows, payment flows
- **Key Insight:** A product stalls when its churn catches up with its customer acquisition. You can analyze growth stalls systematically by asking questions, gathering data, and assessing the stall to zero in on problems. Start with retention benchmarks. "My product is not retaining" is often a fancy phrase for "people don't want to use my product." Moving retention numbers is the hardest thing to move—initial numbers are usually a ceiling. Strong retention with flat growth is actually a good thing—just need more channels.
- **What NOT to Do:** "This next magic feature will fix all our growth problems" (PM), "We need to spend more money on marketing" (Marketer), "Have you considered adding more AI?" (Investor)
- **Retention Benchmarks:** Social app: D1/D7/D30 of 60/30/15%, DAU/MAU over 20%, SMB subscription churn <5%, marketplace supply side >50% YoY retention
- **Two Exceptions for Retention:** (1) Better initial user activation improves long-term retention (first 7 days matter most), (2) Network effects products can have "smile curve" where retention goes up as network fills in
- **Next Feature Fallacy:** The fallacy that the next feature you add will suddenly make people want to use the entire product. Need to listen to "silent majority" who churn, not hardcore users who stay.
- **Growth Loops:** Viral loops (scalable, free), UGC SEO-driven loops (Yelp, Reddit, Glassdoor). Growth loops scale with user base size, keeping up with churn.
- **UX Flows That Matter:** Signup flows (20-50% conversion gains), invite/referral flows (viral factor), payment flows (harvest purchase intent early). These are unsexy but critical.
- **Examples:** Facebook stalled at colleges, then internationally, then before mobile. Dropbox needed referral system and shared folders. TikTok stalled as dance video platform before paid marketing push.

### Superlinear Returns

- **Source:** Paul Graham's Essays
- **Author:** Paul Graham
- **URL:** https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html
- **Date:** October 2023
- **Featured:** Paul Graham, Newton, Durer, Darwin
- **Key Concepts:** Superlinear returns, exponential growth, thresholds, winner take all, learning compounds, work compounds, always be learning, follow curiosity not careerism, democratization of opportunity, doing exceptionally good work, fields with superlinear returns, inequality and superlinear returns, independent-mindedness, do things that don't scale, don't equate work with a job
- **Key Insight:** Returns for performance are superlinear, not linear. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers—you get no customers. Two fundamental causes: exponential growth (when how well you do depends on how well you've done) and thresholds (winner take all). They often combine. Most important case: learning—knowledge grows exponentially and has thresholds. Fields with superlinear returns: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, investing. When excluding sports/politics/fame effects, these are exactly the fields requiring independent-mindedness—where ideas must be novel, not just correct.
- **How to Find Superlinear Returns:** (1) Seek work that compounds—directly (building infrastructure, audience) or by teaching you (learning compounds), (2) Always be learning—if you're not learning, you're probably not on path to superlinear returns, (3) Follow curiosity not careerism—promising questions seem mystifying but perhaps unimportant, (4) Replace mediocre yet popular things, (5) Look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else
- **The Territory Is Expanding:** Progress in technology and decreasing importance of organizations is democratizing opportunity. World dominated by organizations damped variation in returns for performance, but this has eroded. More people can have freedom artists/writers had. More variation in outcomes—those who do well do even better, those who do badly do worse. Not for everyone—most better off as part of pool. For ambitious people who know they're good enough or can afford to risk trying.
- **How to Take Advantage:** Do exceptionally good work—at far end of curve, incremental effort is a bargain, less competition because few even try. Recipe: Choose work with natural aptitude and deep interest, work on own projects, work hard without burning out, reach frontiers of knowledge, notice gaps, explore them, take risks, seek best colleagues, develop good taste, be honest with yourself, exercise/sleep/eat well, follow curiosity. Take multiple shots—luck matters more when working independently, start taking risks early.
- **Key Lessons:** Superlinear returns seem small at first—put in initial effort anyway because reward curve rises steeply at far end (this is "do things that don't scale" in startups). Don't equate work with a job—work is what you carry with you, part of portfolio. If you follow curiosity far enough, you'll end up in field with superlinear returns. Territory not static—most extreme returns come from expanding it. Curiosity may be more powerful than ambition—ambition climbs existing peaks, curiosity may find questions that grow into mountains beneath you.
- **Superlinear Returns Imply Inequality:** Steeper return curve = greater variation in outcomes. This is feature of world, not flaw. Correlation so strong it's heuristic—look for fields where few big winners outperform everyone else.

- **Source:** Ido Shamun's Blog
- **Author:** Ido Shamun (CTO, daily.dev)
- **URL:** https://shamun.dev/posts/startup-handbook
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** daily.dev team (24 team members across 14 countries, remote company)
- **Key Concepts:** Scaling operations, routines, processes, remote teams, transition from garage to organization, alignment, productivity, business goals
- **Key Insight:** Transitioning from the garage, where there are no processes, just a shared goal the founders are working towards, to an organization with over 20 people in two years is one of the biggest challenges you face. How to keep everyone aligned, productive, and hitting business goals. Every routine was introduced to solve a specific problem experienced as we scaled.
- **Routines Covered:** Weekly founders' meeting (oldest routine, ensures quality time together, evolved from technical/hands-on to strategic), Daily standups (written Slack updates to ensure alignment and identify blockers, avoids waste of classic standup meetings), All Hands (weekly alignment meeting with demos, monthly deep dive on business performance), Coffee breaks (3 per week, no agenda, off-topic to build relationships and fight isolation in remote teams), Knowledge sharing (monthly 20-minute presentations on anything), 1-1s (weekly 45-minute meetings, two-sided agenda, understand well-being, align on priorities and growth), Execution sync (fortnightly leadership meeting on delivery and execution, addresses handover bottlenecks between teams), Weekly updates (Slack message covering state of all active projects, fights silos), Monthly business review (monthly retro for business, data analyst reviews metrics, all stakeholders decide how to adjust plans)
- **Product Development Cycle:** Kickoff → Wireframe → Specs & pixel perfect → Technical design (DR) → Development → Launch (99% as experiments). Key learning: The further you are in the process, the more expensive it becomes to fix a mistake. Introduced checkpoints and plan ahead to minimize surprises.
- **Experimentation:** Most features rolled as A/B experiments. Measure impact of everything. If something doesn't work, roll back—no hard feelings, no attachments. Primary target is hitting company goals. Validate hypothesis fast, then refactor. Post-analysis reports shared publicly.
- **Gatherings:** Twice a year in-person meetings for several days. Working sessions, lectures, social activities. Exceptional experience for team.
- **Engineering Practices:** Epic owners and decision records (DRs) for technical approaches. Weekly sprint planning with team leads.
- **Tools:** Google Workspace, Atlassian (Jira, Confluence), Gather.town (virtual office), Slack, Google Cloud, Deel (payroll), Loom, Miro (wireframes), Figma (design), Sendgrid (email), Growthbook (feature flags/experiments). Key principle: Don't battle for weeks over tooling—just pick and move on.
- **Slack Conventions:** Receiver manages notification settings (time zone differences). 👀 reaction = read, response later. Channel prefixes: team (dedicated), feat (feature communication), marketing (campaigns). All channels public by default unless sensitive. Avoid group messages—use public channels for awareness.
- **Organizational Structure:** Reflects founders (CEO, CDO, CTO). Structure not set in stone—experiment and revert if needed. Product (CEO), Marketing (head of marketing), HR/Operations (head of HR), Product design (CDO), Engineering (CTO—platform team and web team, switching from domain to product separation for autonomy), Analytics (CTO—data analyst). Ideal: teams autonomous and able to accomplish tasks independently.
- **Documentation:** Vital for remote/async company. Document processes, decision-making, learning, culture. Accelerates onboarding—new hires get document with goals, tasks, links. DRs for features help engineers understand bigger picture.
- **Key Principles:** (1) Routines solve problems, (2) Evolve with time, (3) Documentation essential for remote, (4) Experimentation mindset, (5) Communication conventions, (6) Structure not set in stone, (7) Fight isolation, (8) Regular business reviews, (9) Checkpoints prevent expensive mistakes, (10) Focus on velocity

- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Craig Dalton, Craig Shapiro (Collab Fund founder)
- **Key Concepts:** Investor reports, monthly updates, investor communication, runway, KPIs, highs and lows, investor asks, follow-on rounds, investor engagement, investor support
- **Key Insight:** I read 1,000 investor reports last year as part of my job. These updates are surprisingly important in terms of how much support a fund can provide. Many people read them (not just the partner who made the investment)—finance and platform teams also read them, and everyone might be able to help. Investors see macro-trends from all their portfolio companies, giving them a bigger picture perspective. Updates keep your business top of mind for follow-on rounds.
- **Essential Elements:** (1) Mission (puts reader in right space, new people join team), (2) How you can help (clearly state asks at top), (3) Finance (monthly burn, cash, runway, headcount, MRR/ARR—12+ months runway = breathing easy, <12 months = on radar for raising soon), (4) KPIs (not particular what they are, but must be figured out and reported consistently—shows you understand your business), (5) Highs (celebrate wins, include pictures), (6) Lows (don't hide them—investors expect things to go wrong but want to see learning), (7) Misc (pictures, brand connection)
- **Format:** Email in body with link to Notion page for details/graphs/pictures. Best practice: all previous updates available via same Notion page (searchable archive). Pick consistent date each month, never miss it. The rigor of this commitment has outsized effect on business management and investor engagement.
- **The Secret to Success:** Founders who cc their entire investor list have proven to be more successful than those who don't. Those who are comfortable sharing ups and downs and desire discourse/advice across cap table are clearly in it to win it.
- **Who Reads:** Partner who made investment, finance team, platform team. Everyone might be able to help, so make it easy for them.
- **Investor Perspective:** Investors not involved in day-to-day operations, see macro-trends from many companies, can offer bigger picture perspective, keeps business top of mind for follow-on and insider-led rounds.

### Answering the Defensibility Question

- **Source:** Guy Kawasaki's Blog
- **Author:** Guy Kawasaki
- **URL:** https://guykawasaki.com/how_to_change_t/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Guy Kawasaki, Curtis Thompson (who asked the question)
- **Key Concepts:** Defensibility, investor questions, patents, domain expertise, head start, escape velocity, critical mass, competition, startup positioning, Web 2.0 companies
- **Key Insight:** "Defensible Web 2.0 company" is an oxymoron in the sense of a quick, irrefutable response. This is one of the hardest questions for entrepreneurs—it's a trick question to see what you're made of. Experienced investors aren't expecting a bulletproof answer but want to see if you're street wise, clueful, and cool under pressure. Requires combination of clairvoyance, street wisdom, humility, honesty, and cockiness.
- **Three Worst Answers:** (1) "Patents make our business defensible" - As startup, unlikely to have time/money to battle big competitors, exception is biotech/chip design/medical devices, (2) "We're the only guys who can do this" - Signal you're clueless and don't know how to use Google, (3) "[Big competitor] won't compete; they'll buy us out" - Grand delusion, Bozo Hall of Fame
- **Top Ten Best Answers:** (1) "We know there are no 'magic bullets'" - Shows you've been around, (2) "We filed for patents but know we can't depend on them" - Perfect treatment, (3) "We have x month head start (if >9 months) and what we're doing is hard" - Shows temporary lead but clueful enough to know leads don't last, (4) "We've built similar businesses before" - Advantage of experience, (5) "We've amassed domain expertise because founders sold to these customers before" - Inside track with contacts and reputation, (6) "We used to work at [big company], so we know it won't compete - we quit because management refused to address this market" - Twofer: inside info and domain expertise, (7) "We've signed up key customers like [big names] - they'd know of better solutions if they existed" - Third-party confirmation, (8) "Backing of firm like yours will dissuade others from investing in competitors, plus world-class Rolodex" - Suck up but investors love it, (9) "We expect competition because this is a real business in a big market" - Big market with competition beats dominating market that doesn't exist, (10) "It's a race, we're going to work like hell to reach escape velocity" - Ultimate defensibility = critical mass and becoming synonymous with market/category/task
- **The Picture to Paint:** Street wise (can't depend on patents), understand few companies defensible except by critical mass or 9+ month head start, have domain expertise/connections/doing hard things, not only team but better positioned than most, believe can build better than anyone (necessary cockiness)
- **Reality Check:** These explanations only work on investor who already fundamentally believes. If they don't believe, nothing you say will convince them, and defensibility isn't the sole reason—move on, achieving success is sweetest revenge

### Patents and IP Strategy: A Counterpoint

- **Source:** Guy Kawasaki's Blog
- **Author:** J. Matthew Buchanan, Douglas J. Sorocco, and Stephen M. Nipper (Rethink(IP))
- **URL:** https://guykawasaki.com/counterpoint_pa/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Guy Kawasaki, patent attorneys at Rethink(IP)
- **Key Concepts:** Patent law, intellectual property strategy, trade secrets, defensive publications, trademarks, domain names, branding strategy, invention management, eBay vs. MercExchange
- **Key Insight:** Counterpoint to Guy Kawasaki's piece on defensibility. Patent law is currently a sea of chaos, and patents don't pack the oomph they once did, particularly for startups. eBay vs. MercExchange changed value of patents for small companies. Application backlog at PTO is all-time high—average 30+ months to issue, 5+ years in backlogged tech areas, delays up to 10+ years. Tech startups can't count on patents to shut down Microsofts of the world. BUT patents still play important role—just not the whole enchilada. Need comprehensive IP strategy, not knee-jerk "Patent Everything!" or "Patent Nothing!"
- **Put Patents in Right Place:** Ask "Should we patent?" at end of invention management. Consider: (1) How competitors using patents? (Biotech/pharma/medical devices—can't get past Go without them), (2) Better as trade secret? (Coca-Cola formula example—need to maintain secrecy in-house, competitors can't reverse engineer. Drawback: competitor later patents same thing = no protection), (3) Make publicly available? (Source code/API—community support, critical mass), (4) Defensive publication? (Donate to public domain to prevent competitors from patenting—IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin example. Once released, genie can't go back)
- **Value Beyond Litigation:** Patents add value beyond ability to sue: (1) Selling point ("patented technology"), (2) Block competitors from getting patents (keeps them from suing you), (3) Counter-offensive weapons (counter-sue if sued, threat can prevent suit or force settlement), (4) Bluff smaller competitors (nuisance value settlement cheaper than court battle), (5) Portfolio for acquirers (who can afford to sue)
- **Inventions First, Patents Second:** Think about role of inventions in business first—are they important component of value and growth? If so, develop efficient system: invention disclosure forms, processing systems, regular review meetings, annual cataloging with decision-makers
- **Trademarks and Branding:** Get trademarks that are strong and protectable. Check domain name availability—many don't spend enough time on this. Get the domain name—can't afford to lose this race. Get typos and variant domains too ($9 insurance vs. thousands in legal fees later—Utube.com vs. Youtube.com example). Develop overall branding strategy including domain name. Branding as important as technology. Don't wait too long—sucks to rebrand 20 months in because didn't get legal opinion. Solid branding with appropriate protections creates significant value. Example: How great would it be to call your search company "Google"? You can't.
- **Bottom Line:** If patent attorney tells you to patent everything without regard to bigger picture, find new one. Good patent attorney looks at bigger picture and proposes strategy, not disparate tactics. Patents aren't end-all answer to defensibility. "We've got tons and tons of patents!" alone looks clueless. BUT strong IP strategy designed in context of relevant industry CAN give you defensibility.

- **Key Concepts:** Elevator pitches, pitch templates, storytelling in pitches, pitch types (one-word, question, rhyming, subject line, Twitter, Pixar), pitch amplifiers, psychological persuasion tactics, Dragon's Den, Shark Tank
- **Key Insight:** "The first thing, the absolute first thing, that anyone 'buys' from you is your big idea embedded in story form." Most pitches fail not because the product or team are poor, but because the pitch structure and story weren't well thought out. Elevator pitches should be 30 seconds to 2 minutes, distilling ideas into simplest points of value and instilling curiosity. Six types of pitches beyond standard templates: one-word, question, rhyming, subject line, Twitter, and Pixar pitches. Pitch amplifiers include shock/intrigue, metaphor, clarity, emotional appeal, tangible demonstration, risk reduction, authority, scarcity, repetition, contrast, story, and time. Based on experience coaching hundreds of companies and preparing five companies for Dragon's Den/Shark Tank pitches. Referenced Daniel Pink's "To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others" for six pitch types.

- **Featured:** Lenny Rachitsky
- **Key Concepts:** Early user acquisition, seven strategies for getting first users, case studies from Tinder, Uber, Dropbox, Instagram, Airbnb, Slack, Product Hunt, Pinterest, Netflix, TikTok, and more
- **Key Insight:** Just seven strategies account for every consumer app's early growth: (1) Go where your target users are, offline, (2) Go where your target users are, online, (3) Invite your friends, (4) Create FOMO in order to drive word-of-mouth, (5) Leverage influencers, (6) Get press, (7) Build a community pre-launch. Most startups found their early users from just a single strategy. A few like Product Hunt and Pinterest found success using a handful. No one found success from more than three. The most popular strategies involve going to your user directly—online, offline, and through friends. Doing things that don't scale. To execute on any of these strategies, it's important to first narrowly define your target user. The tactics that you use to get your first 1,000 users are very different from your next 10,000. Based on first-hand accounts from founders of major consumer apps.

- **Key Concepts:** Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), targeting, positioning, marketing messaging, customer segmentation, bullseye targeting
- **Key Insight:** "Selling to everyone means selling to no one." Targeting your ICP (Carol) actually brings 10x more customers than you expected because clear messaging attracts people with similar purchasing preferences (Diana, 10x larger) and those who weigh trade-offs in your favor (Eddie, 20x-100x larger). Generalized messaging has no power, no emotional connection, no interest, no information. It's impossible to speak to everybody at once. When you target Carol, your positioning is strongest, and you win where you deserve to win. But far more people will buy because they have similar purchasing preferences. Examples: Subaru targeting lesbians in the '90s (risky at the time) led to fastest growth of any car company, with majority of buyers being straight. Twilio targets developers, Dollar Shave Club was "cheap but good," each speaking clearly to their ICP. Need to identify Carols, prioritize them over revenue (turn down non-ICP sales), ignore noise from non-ICP customers. This separates first-time founders from seasoned founders. Focus on Carol in everything: messaging, product, metrics, decisions. Everything else is noise.

### The Mid-Market Briar Patch

- **Source:** A Smart Bear
- **Author:** Jason Cohen
- **URL:** https://longform.asmartbear.com/mid-market/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Jason Cohen
- **Key Concepts:** Market segmentation, mid-market targeting, B2B sales, market selection, startup mistakes
- **Key Insight:** "Mid-sized companies: Small enough to have small budgets, big enough for bureaucratic nightmares." The mid-market is the worst of both worlds—startup graveyards are littered with companies who tried to target this segment. They have arduous sales processes like big companies but small budgets like small companies. At 400 employees, they've already established bureaucracy and processes of much larger companies. Fear of change trumps potential rewards from improvement. You have to sell 30 mid-sized companies for every large one to get the same revenue (average 119 employees vs 3,100), and sales effort isn't much different between 75 seats or 750 seats. "Mid-sized companies" isn't really a market segment anyway—industry and problems matter more than size. A 100-person tech startup has very different makeup than a 100-person plastics manufacturer. Common misconception: "Small businesses have no money, and large companies use entrenched competitors, so opportunity is in the middle." But there isn't necessarily an opportunity—maybe competitors figured out it's not cost-effective. WP Engine example: initially tried mid-market WordPress hosting, then optimized around choosing one or the other. Only expand to mid-market when you can spend tens of millions on proper infrastructure. Focus on small companies OR large companies—pick one. If you're going after mid-market anyway, you better have extenuating circumstances that make you the exception.

### Second-Order Thinking

- **Source:** Farnam Street
- **URL:** https://fs.blog/second-order-thinking/
- **Date:** Published on Farnam Street
- **Referenced Works:** Howard Marks' *The Most Important Thing*, Ray Dalio
- **Key Concepts:** Second-order thinking, second-level thinking, thinking through consequences, decision-making, mental models
- **Key Insight:** First-order thinking is fast and easy but everyone reaches the same conclusions. Second-order thinking is more deliberate, thinking in terms of interactions and time, asking "And then what?" Extraordinary performance comes from seeing things that other people can't see. Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences causes a lot of painfully bad decisions. Practice: Always ask "And then what?", think across time (10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years), create templates listing consequences, consider ecosystem responses (employees, competitors, suppliers, regulators). A lot of extraordinary things in life are first-order negative, second order positive—less competition because first-order thinkers won't think things through. Second-order thinking takes work but separates you from the masses.

### Avoiding the Wrong MVP Approach

- **URL:** https://jmspool.medium.com/avoiding-the-wrong-mvp-approach-65fe3e5c5c28
- **Date:** 2025
- **Featured:** Jared M. Spool
- **Key Concepts:** MVP, minimum viable product, minimum viable experiment, product development, assumption validation
- **Key Insight:** MVPs often don't need code, but teams forget this. Organizations are so used to solving every problem with software that they forget they can learn what they need by faster, more efficient means. The minimum viable experiment asks: "What's the smallest test we can run to validate our riskiest assumption?" Before writing code, ask: (1) What's the riskiest assumption we're making? (2) What's the smallest test we can run to validate it? (3) Does that test require code, or can we learn faster without it? Example: Insurance company wanted customers to take photos instead of sending photographers. Instead of building an app, first test if customer photos are adequate—ask customers to email photos and see if adjusters can use them. This takes days, costs nothing, and validates the core assumption. Only after validating that assumption would software make sense. Some teams use "minimum viable experiment" instead of MVP to differentiate from the bias that code = product. If you can learn without building, do that first. Code comes later, after you've validated that the idea actually works.

### Signs You Aren't Really Building a Minimum Viable Product

- **Featured:** Anthony Panozzo
- **Referenced Works:** Eric Ries' *The Lean Startup*
- **Key Concepts:** MVP, minimum viable product, validated learning, build-measure-learn loop, assumption validation, success criteria
- **Key Insight:** Most so-called "MVPs" are not really MVPs because they are not focused on the process of learning, and as a result, wasteful. MVP is not a minimal product, it is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers. "The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." MVPs can be many things: landing pages, paper prototypes, pretending to be a magical algorithm, going to bus stops to test carpool ideas, etc. Concerns when MVP term is used loosely: (1) little emphasis on what assumptions the MVP seeks to validate, (2) no clear success or failure criteria, (3) there might be an easier way to learn. The build-measure-learn (BML) loop should be thought through in reverse—first focus on what we want to learn, then how we'll measure it, then how we should build. Any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste. If you can't answer three questions, you're not building a real MVP: (1) What are you trying to learn? (2) What data are you collecting? (3) What determines success or failure? Without learning, you're not going through the feedback loop—just building version 1.0.

### For God's Sake, Follow the Lean Startup Method

- **Referenced Works:** Eric Ries' *The Lean Startup*, Lenny Rachitsky podcast, Greg Isenberg, Hiten Shah
- **Key Concepts:** Lean Startup, MVP, pivot, validated learning, risk management, overfunding, VC landscape, product differentiation
- **Key Insight:** Most people have read the Lean Startup but haven't understood the key message. The article addresses criticisms and updates the method for 2024. MVP spectrum model: 0 (idea on paper) to 100 (final product in 5 years), with X being the risk factor. The MVP is the factual embodiment of a hypothetical X risk-factor. Lower X = less upfront risk but less validation. Higher X = more validation but more initial risk. MVP isn't minimum effort, it's minimum *viable*—a tool to test hypotheses. Whether testing is costly or cheap is subjective and depends on your criteria. The cost of producing software has decreased (AWS, remote teams), but the cost of creating a differentiated MVP has increased (market saturation, customer expectations). Consumer expectations have risen, but that's separate from what an MVP is conceptually. Pivoting has evolved: pivot not just because first idea isn't working, but because you've found one that is. Overfunding is now a risk—capital abundance doesn't mean you should burn fast (Stripe example: $20M in bank, took 6 months to hire first 2 people). Lean Startup doesn't apply to top 1% well-funded "blockbuster startups" (Quibi, Powa Technologies examples) that operate like major film productions. For 99% of startups: validate ideas, test hypotheses early, stay grounded, do simple things extremely well, spend lots of time with customers, get really good at customer interviews.

- **Key Insight:** 13 principles for achieving outlier success based on observations of thousands of founders. Everything is easier once you've reached a baseline of success (through privilege or effort), but much applies to anyone. Key principles include: (1) Compound yourself - be an exponential curve, not linear; look for network effects, leverage (capital, technology, brand, network effects, managing people); long-term thinking is the biggest competitive advantage; (2) Have almost too much self-belief, balanced with self-awareness - most successful people believe in themselves almost to delusion; Elon Musk's SpaceX Mars conviction as benchmark; listen to criticism assuming it's true, then decide; truth-seeking separates self-belief from self-delusion; (3) Learn to think independently - entrepreneurship hard to teach because original thinking is; "I will fail many times, and I will be really right once" is the entrepreneurs' way; (4) Get good at "sales" - all great careers become sales jobs; evangelize to customers, employees, press, investors; best sales tip: show up in person; (5) Make it easy to take risks - most people overestimate risk, underestimate reward; small bets: lose 1x if wrong, make 100x if works; problem with Google/Facebook founders: comfortable life makes leaving hard; keep life cheap and flexible; (6) Focus is a force multiplier - more important to work on right thing than work many hours; (7) Work hard - 90th percentile by smart OR hard, 99th percentile needs both; work stamina is biggest predictor of long-term success; do it at beginning of career; (8) Be bold - easier to do hard startup than easy startup; follow curiosity; (9) Be willful - can bend world to your will surprising percentage of time; Airbnb benchmark for persistence; must be optimistic; (10) Be hard to compete with - build leverage (relationships, brand, intersection of fields); avoid mimetic behavior; (11) Build a network - help people; be overly generous with upside; put people in roles they're great at; discover undiscovered talent; ask "is this person a force of nature?"; (12) You get rich by owning things, not selling time - own equity in things that increase rapidly in value; (13) Be internally driven - work to impress yourself, not others; externally driven leads to consensus ideas, wrong risk calculations; Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham as benchmarks; hard to be successful at anything you aren't obsessed with.

### How to Be Great? Just Be Good, Repeatably

- **Date:** 2025

- **Referenced Works:** James Clear's *Atomic Habits*, *Outliers* by Malcolm Gladwell, Napoleon Hill, Henri Bergson, Jerry Uelsmann photography study
- **Key Concepts:** Greatness, consistency, habits, compound effects, local minima/maxima, hedonic treadmill, inputs and outputs, habit of progression, iteration, two steps out, action over speculation
- **Key Insight:** "Perhaps 'great', is just 'good', but repeatable." Greatness is not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits. Greatness is not instantaneous—it's earned through a reflection of a period of effort. Being "great" is about being dependable and disciplined, not better than someone else. Two key principles: (1) Inputs are consistent over time; (2) Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs. The most sure way to success is through consistency, not being flashy. "If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times." Focus on consistently achieving small wins done in a good way, repeatably—not perfection. Life is a series of nodes with compounding (earlier steps more strenuous, difficult to imagine later compounding) and ups/downs (we quit at local minimums because we can't see next peak). Hedonic treadmill makes down moments harder—baseline shifts with new successes. Fall in love with boredom and the process. Acting with intention—learn what inputs deliver outputs (30% success rate vs 5% flying blind). Best things in life are well-thought out approaches that are sustainable, not miracles. Great companies stand the test of time (Zoom 8 years vs Juicero bankruptcy in 1 year). "Moving fast and breaking things" needs a learning process. Habit of progression: become good at being decent. Create more nodes of optimization—test things every month/week (pilot a lot), not every year. Ask: "If I were to continue this every day for the next year, would I be in a better place?" You can only ever see two steps out—can't fully conceptualize levels far ahead (Tier 57 can see 58-59, not 21 or 89). Stop speculating—quantity group produces better photos than quality group because they take action. Instead of speculating greatness, get out there and start doing. Reframe: "How do I become good" not "How do I become great." In being consistent over time, you become the outlier.

### The Dumber Side of Smart People

- **Referenced:** Robin Williams, Bryan Cranston/Seinfeld story, LeBron James
- **Key Concepts:** Intelligence pitfalls, overconfidence, humility, credentialism, intellectual reputation, changing your mind, expertise shelf life
- **Key Insight:** "Too much of a good thing" applies to intelligence. Three ways intelligence becomes a disadvantage: (1) Very smart people can fool themselves with elaborate stories about why something happened—they create complex models when "I don't know" might be the right answer. Humility is a superpower that prevents overconfidence, but being smart makes it harder to harness. There's a fine line between intellectual rigor and believing your own bullshit. Professional money managers' lousy returns partly because industry attracts intelligent people who are too smart for their own good. (2) Being very smart makes it harder to listen to less credentialed people—being smart is a tribe, and tribal affiliations make it hard to view outsiders as equals. "Best idea wins" regardless of source. Bryan Cranston: "A very smart CEO should listen to every suggestion—best idea wins. And you never know where it's gonna come from." Management consultants solving problems that line workers had solutions for. (3) Having an intellectual reputation makes it hard to change your mind—world evolves but smart person is desperate to hold onto perceived consistency. Become known as expert in something that no longer exists. Market yourself as expert, so hard to evolve. Smart people cling to bad ideas because of reputation. Hedge fund manager from 1990s vs. garbageman—latter more attuned to current reality without intellectual baggage. Biggest risk to evolving system: bogged down by experts from world that no longer exists. Expertise has shelf life. Most susceptible: smartest people who flashed brilliance but struggle to admit it can't be repeated.

- **Key Concepts:** Small teams, deadlines, promises, communication, ownership, hierarchy, commitments, mistakes, resources, relationships
- **Key Insight:** A concise manifesto with 20 principles for small teams doing important work. Core themes: Time is most valuable asset—always under tight deadlines. Promises and dates: set dates for promises, meet them, communicate early if you can't. Ownership: clean up your own mess and others' messes. Communication: overcommunicate; question premises/strategy but not goodwill/effort/intent. Professionalism: "I'll know it when I see it" is not professional—describe and discuss in abstract. Priorities: big projects less important than scary commitments; if your work doesn't matter to mission, help others. Learning: make mistakes, own them, fix them, share learning. Tools: cheap, reliable, public software usually better. Hierarchy: yesterday's hierarchy less important than today's project structure. Flexibility: lock in what must be locked in, leave implementation loose. Reality: we do things that haven't been done before—don't be surprised when surprised. Caring: care more. Outsourcing: if outsider can do it faster/cheaper, don't hesitate; always seek outside resources. Relationships: talk to everyone the same way (boss, customer, founder, employee). Personal: it works because it's personal.

- **Context:** Based on 80 events and nearly 5000 attendees across France. THE QUEST startups have gone from 0 to 22M€ cumulative ARR in 4 years.
- **Key Concepts:** Startup definition, junk markets, starting fast, pirate mindset, intensity, co-founders, true fans, customer revenue, mentors/incubators, startup readiness
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive guide to 10 most common mistakes: (1) Not understanding startups = profitable/repeatable/scalable (PRODUCT not service). (2) Junk markets = bad clients (few, rigid, small jackpot). (3) Not starting TODAY - speed of execution is key; examples: landing pages, mockups, newsletters, manual connections. (4) Pirates in rare supply - act of rebellion, hacker mindset, don't partner with big corps. (5) Need more intensity - energy #1 ally, marathon of sprints, missionary not mercenary. (6) Alter Ego vs Alter Zero - find someone you love for 20 years, start alone if needed, communication key, 50/50 even if you started first. (7) True fans > too good friends - 10 true fans better than 100 unengaged, friends say "cool" (bad sign), get hands dirty, Lady Gaga example. (8) Customer money is king - only exception: complex tech products. (9) Mentors/incubators often wrong - old people say impossible, incubators want rent not success. (10) Is startup right for you? - If not ready to drop out, do "stuff" instead; prepare with creativity, network, side projects, learn skills.

- **Key Concepts:** Pitch decks, investor presentations, fundraising, startup pitches, visual storytelling, problem-solution narrative, market opportunity, business model, financials, social proof, competitive differentiation, team slide
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive analysis of 37 successful pitch decks that raised millions in funding. Core principles: (1) Pitch decks don't have to be formal or beautiful - prioritize clarity and effectiveness. (2) Provide impactful intro/slogan - describe business in few words, like telling a 5-year-old. (3) Keep deck short (less than 20 pages, ideally 10-15 slides). (4) Use analogies to back up points. What to include: strong intro/vision, show problems and solutions, identify market opportunities, showcase products/services clearly, digest business model, highlight financials, add social proof/case studies, differentiate from competition, show experienced management team. Key takeaways from examples: Facebook focused on solid numbers (user engagement, traffic, growth). TikTok showed virtuous cycle visualization (growth flywheel). Airbnb's intro hooks audience with simplicity. YouTube wanted to be primary outlet for video content. Dropbox kept it simple and relatable, addressing common problems with clear language. Uber was clean and minimalist, clear problem-solution flow. Buffer based deck on solid numbers from users. Square promoted management team for social proof. LinkedIn used analogies (Web 1.0 vs 2.0). Mint showed clear value proposition and exit strategy options. Front used visual storytelling. Peloton differentiated with "Who We Are? & What We Are Not?" slide. Tinder proved simplicity works - clear problem, innovative solution, solid market analysis. Avoid overcomplicating, too many slides, jargon overload, missing the hook, ignoring the problem. DocSend analyzed 200 startups who raised $360 million from their first pitch deck - patterns show clarity, simplicity, strong narrative, and solid data win.

- **Key Concepts:** Business failures, bankruptcies, corporate fraud, pitch decks, SPAC failures, valuation crashes, startup failures, financial institution failures, retail failures
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive collection of pitch decks and presentations from 50+ companies that failed, went bankrupt, or committed fraud. Categories include: (1) Startup failures - Astra Space ($2.1B valuation, down 99%), Byju's ($22B to $25M), Bird ($2B to bankruptcy), WeWork ($47B to bankruptcy), Convoy ($3.8B to shutdown), SmileDirectClub ($8.9B to bankruptcy), IRL ($1.2B with 95% fake users), Virgin Orbit ($3.7B to $36M asset sale). (2) Corporate fraud - FTX (crypto exchange collapse), Theranos (blood testing fraud), Nikola (truck fraud), Wirecard (€1.9B missing), Fyre Festival (fraudulent event), Frank (fake customers to JPMorgan). (3) Financial institution failures - Silicon Valley Bank (interest rate crisis), Credit Suisse (scandals and risky bets), Signature Bank (crypto exposure, bank run). (4) Historical corporate failures - Enron ($60B bankruptcy), WorldCom (largest bankruptcy at time), Lehman Brothers (largest U.S. bankruptcy), Bear Stearns ($2/share rescue). (5) Retail failures - Toys "R" Us (debt load from LBO), Blockbuster (Netflix competition), Bed Bath & Beyond ($17B to bankruptcy). Key lessons: Beware of overpromising, fraud always gets exposed, market conditions matter, valuation isn't reality, SPACs increased risk, business model flaws are fatal, regulatory scrutiny is real, competition is unforgiving, debt can be fatal, trust is fragile. Many failures show pattern of high valuations via SPAC followed by rapid collapse, inability to deliver on promises, and fundamental business model issues.

### Predict the Future

- **Source:** A Smart Bear (Longform)
- **Author:** Jason Cohen
- **URL:** https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Reading Time:** 23 minutes
- **Key Concepts:** Strategy, prediction, unpredictability, optionality, moats, customer behavior, product pivots, base rates, forecasting, strategic thinking
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive exploration of why experts consistently fail to predict the future (Goldman Sachs analysts, McKinsey consultants, chess grandmasters all get it wrong), yet why strategy is still essential. The article provides evidence from economic forecasting (T-Bill rates, oil receipts, solar installations consistently underestimated), drug sales predictions (almost two-thirds miss by 40%+), and even chess tournaments (Carlsen was favorite but Giri won). Paradox: Base rates don't help (Musk predicted 50% CAGR for Tesla, base rate showed <3% average with no companies >40%, yet Tesla achieved 55%). Solution: Have a strategy (even when wrong) and follow customer behavior. Case studies: Slack (Game Neverending → Flickr → Glitch → Slack, where Butterfield insisted on "organizational transformation" but customers wanted "just chat"), WhatsApp (status updates → push notifications → group chat → "SMS but free"), Code Collaborator (abuse of Code Historian for peer review became 97% of revenue). Ten strategies that defeat unpredictability: (1) Build a moat, (2) Have more than one way to succeed (optionality), (3) Leverage your assets, (4) Intentionally reactive (iterate fast, learn fast), (5) Hedged bets (insurance-like strategies), (6) Extreme novelty (new categories), (7) Form coalitions, (8) Expand scope of prediction (Futures Cone), (9) Stay simple, (10) Bet on what will not change (Bezos method). Key principles: Strategy is required even when wrong (gives direction, creates interesting things that attract early fans), customer behavior is always directionally right (customers are where you discover how to upgrade strategy), product "abuse" is a strong signal. The article emphasizes that deliberation assumes we know how to reason about the future, but even experts aren't good at that—making decisions and gaining experience is how to find the right answers.

### Startup Pricing 101

- **Source:** Y Combinator Library
- **Author:** Kevin Hale (YC Partner)
- **URL:** https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6h-startup-pricing-101
- **Date:** Over 1 year ago (as of January 2025)
- **Views:** 197K+
- **Key Concepts:** Pricing, monetization, value-based pricing, cost-plus pricing, early adopters, price optimization, acquisition strategy, pricing thermometer, unit economics, SMB danger zone, 10/5/20 rule
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive fundamentals of pricing for startups from first principles. Core concepts: The pricing thermometer (cost, price, value relationships - gap between price and cost is margin/incentive to sell, gap between price and value is incentive to buy). Two pricing approaches: cost-plus (start with cost) vs value-based (start with value - preferred for startups). Four common mistakes: (1) Pricing too low (most common, consistently undercharge), (2) They don't understand your value, (3) You don't know how to convince them, (4) Focusing on wrong customers. Why pricing is hard for startups: You're in product development/introduction stages, targeting early adopters (2-5% of market), not mainstream customers. Early adopters are not price-sensitive - they care about benefits above all else, want to beat competition, willing to take risks. If you charge too low, it creates reputation risk ("too good to be true"). Price optimization: Simple table with price, conversion rate, sales volume, revenue - try different prices and see effect. Danger zone: SMB pricing ($100-$1,000/year) is struggle bus - customers treat money like consumers but look like enterprise. How price determines acquisition strategy: Self-serve ($2K or less) = inbound only, no sales team, same-day conversions. Transactional ($2K-$10K) = qualified leads, SLAs, inside sales, 1-3 month cycle. Enterprise ($25K+) = branding, high-touch support, sales managers, 6-12 month cycle. Garbage zone: Months to close but not enough revenue to cover acquisition costs. The 10/5/20 rule: (1) Value should be 10X price and easily understood, (2) Start raising prices by 5%, (3) Keep raising until losing 20% of deals. Key takeaways: Pricing gives biggest ROI (1% effort = highest return vs acquisition 3.32%, retention 6.7%), understand costs/price/value, go after early adopters (not price-sensitive), your price determines what acquisition strategies you can afford, most startups consistently undercharge.

### Price Before Product. Period.

- **Source:** First Round Review
- **Author:** Madhavan Ramanujam (Simon-Kucher & Partners)
- **URL:** https://review.firstround.com/its-price-before-product-period/
- **Date:** Published on First Round Review
- **Featured:** Described by Bill Gurley as "to monetization strategy what Bob Marley is to reggae music"
- **Key Concepts:** Price before product, willingness to pay (WTP), feature shock, minivations, hidden gems, undead products, customer segmentation, monetization models, product development process
- **Key Insight:** Powerful argument that you should determine price BEFORE designing your product. Core thesis: "The root of all innovation evil is the failure to put the customer's willingness to pay [WTP] for a new product at the very core of product design." Case studies: Porsche Cayenne success (designed around price, became half of company profit) vs Fiat Chrysler failure (product first, price last, forced layoffs). Research shows 72% of innovations fail to meet revenue/profit targets because pricing is postponed until after development. Four ways companies trip up: (1) Feature Shock - too many features, over-engineered, nothing stands out (Amazon Fire Phone $170M write-down), (2) Minivations - right product, wrong price, under-monetized (Asus mini-notebook, demand exceeded supply by 900% but underpriced), (3) Hidden Gems - should have developed but didn't (Kodak had digital photography in 1974, didn't release until 1995, bankrupt by 2012), (4) Undead - should never be released (Segway $3K-$7K price killed mass market). Three key rules: (1) Have WTP talk early - ask acceptable/expensive/prohibitive price questions, identify "price cliffs" and psychological thresholds, 80% of companies wait until last minute, (2) Investigate how you charge as much as what you charge - monetization model innovation (Michelin charged by mileage not tires, 20% more revenue), (3) Don't settle for one-size-fits-all - segment by WTP/needs/values (Garmin different products for drivers/golfers/runners/hikers/bikers, water example: free fountain/$2 bottle/$2.50 with gas/$5 minibar). Segmentation principles: Start with WTP data, don't be beholden to stats (ask salespeople if they can sort clients), fewer is more (start 3-4 segments), don't try to serve every segment, describe segments so you can address them. Key takeaways: Without a price, you don't have a product. Build products around price, not hope. Transition from hoping to knowing by making price your core focus. Most companies think product first, price last - this is backwards.

### Nine Rules from Monetizing Innovation

- **Source:** SKMurphy.com Blog
- **Author:** Sean Murphy
- **URL:** https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2016/11/16/nine-rules-from-monetizing-innovation/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Based On:** "Monetizing Innovation" by Madhavan Ramanujam and George Tacke
- **Key Concepts:** Pricing rules, willingness to pay, segmentation, pricing models, value communication, pricing integrity, product-market fit
- **Key Insight:** Concise summary of nine essential rules for successfully monetizing innovation. The rules are: (1) Have WTP talk early - pricing is key to product-market fit, (2) Don't force one-size-fits-all - segment by WTP differences, (3) Product configuration is science, not art - use jobs-to-be-done for B2B, (4) Choose right pricing model - how you charge often matters more than how much, (5) Develop pricing strategy - look ahead, manage early discount transition, (6) Draft business case using WTP data - link price/value/volume/cost, base price on value created, (7) Communicate value clearly - less is more (2-3 features), tailor to job customer needs done, (8) Understand irrational sides - customers are people, for B2B understand industry culture/language (shibboleth test), (9) Maintain pricing integrity - control discounting tightly, price cuts as last resort. Key takeaways: Pricing is key to PMF, early WTP conversations prioritize features, segmentation matters for pricing/messaging, how you charge matters as much as how much, value-based pricing essential, focus communication on 2-3 compelling outcomes, understand customer context deeply, maintain pricing discipline. Author notes that First Round post captures 80% of value for startups, recommends "The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing" by Thomas Nagle for deeper pricing analysis, and notes early sales often look like consulting engagements.

### The Sequoia Guide to Pricing

- **Source:** Sequoia Capital Articles
- **Author:** Sequoia Capital
- **URL:** https://articles.sequoiacap.com/pricing-your-product
- **Date:** Published on Sequoia Capital Articles
- **Key Concepts:** Perceived value, pricing psychology, decoy pricing, pinch points, snap judgments, horizontal/vertical assortment, endowment effect, pricing hypothesis
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive guide to pricing that emphasizes pricing is as much art as science, relying on marketing and psychology as much as classical economics. Core thesis: "Pricing is not a math problem, it's a judgment problem." Key concepts: (1) Increase perceived value - focus on gap between price and perceived value, not just cost vs price. If nobody's buying, it's because gap between price and perceived value doesn't exist or isn't large enough. Use better marketing to increase perceived value (eBay photo feature example - 25 cents generated hundreds of millions in profit once sellers saw the data). (2) Let price tell a story - price serves as proxy for quality ("Premium pricing communicates a premium product" - Natera example). Where you display price matters. Horizontal assortment (multiple products at similar prices, e.g., iPhone colors) vs vertical assortment (multiple price points, e.g., iPhone storage tiers). Allow a la carte features for real-time feedback. (3) Know your pinch points - identify features where customers feel emotionally compelled to pay. LinkedIn example: Identified 10% features (power search, contact ability) that heavy users valued, created premium accounts, generated $248M revenue. (4) Design for snap judgments - people don't act rationally, make split-second decisions using shortcuts and reference points (loafer example - teenager vs businessman). Weebly example: "Free and easy" associated with cheap, revamped to "create a site as unique as you are" with high-quality imagery. Evernote banned swag and discount promotions to protect perceived value. (5) Decoy pricing - Economist subscription example (print-only $125 made combo $125 look like better deal, 84% chose combo vs 68% when decoy removed). Use decoys to make expensive products look affordable. (6) Endowment effect - people overvalue what they have, harder to win customers from competitors. (7) Pricing hypothesis framework - analyze substitutes/complements, snap judgments vs rigorous analysis, perceived value (bounded by substitutes), market breadth. Key principles: Customers are analytical but prone to leaps of logic, want bargains based on arbitrary reference points, don't want to feel on the hook for wrong choices. If you picked price once and never changed it, it's probably wrong. Case studies: LinkedIn premium ($248M revenue), eBay photo feature (hundreds of millions profit), Weebly rebranding, Evernote brand protection, Natera premium pricing, Economist decoy pricing.

### Pricing Determines Your Business Model

- **Source:** A Smart Bear (Longform)
- **Author:** Jason Cohen
- **URL:** https://longform.asmartbear.com/pricing-determines-your-business-model/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Reading Time:** 6 minutes
- **Key Concepts:** Pricing tiers, business model, customer segments, bootstrapped vs VC-funded, B2B vs B2C, sales processes, freemium
- **Key Insight:** Powerful argument that price fundamentally determines your entire business model—who your customers are, how they buy, what you can afford to build, your funding needs, growth strategy, everything. Core thesis: "Price is not an afterthought, it is essential business design." Disagrees with conventional wisdom to avoid talking about price in customer interviews—argues price is as important as any feature for product-market fit. Breaks down consequences of each order-of-magnitude price point: $0/mo (maximize growth, requires VC funding, typically B2C, freemium model), $1/mo (no customer service, self-service product, word-of-mouth marketing, viral growth), $10/mo (cheap version positioning, takes 8000 customers for $1M revenue, 10-year slog, hard to scale without VC, but people forget they have it = "free revenue"), $100/mo (support expected, almost exclusively B2B, sweet spot for bootstrapped companies—profitable with 200-300 customers, can afford acquisition), $1,000/mo (medium/large companies only, sales force required, case studies/logos needed, difficult profitability zone—same costs as larger sales but less revenue), $10,000/mo (larger companies only, professional services needed, usage/performance-based can work for mid-size), $100,000/mo (Global 2000 only, 9-18 month sales cycles, massive cash outlay, on-site visits required, examples: WorkDay, IBM). Key takeaway: Bring price into customer interviews—talk about cost expectations, who writes check, approval process, ROI arguments, what justifies doubling price. Price determines by whom, why, how, and when customers buy. Each price point has different implications for product complexity, support expectations, sales process, funding needs, and business model.

### Monthly vs. Annual Subscription Model

- **Source:** Stax Bill Blog
- **Author:** Eric Simmons (Senior Director, Growth Marketing at Stax)
- **URL:** https://staxbill.com/blog/monthly-annual-subscription-model-for-business/
- **Date:** Published on Stax Bill Blog
- **Key Concepts:** Monthly subscriptions, annual subscriptions, subscription models, churn rates, customer retention, revenue recognition, ASC 606, deferred revenue, CAC, customer acquisition cost
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive comparison of monthly vs annual subscription models for SaaS businesses. Monthly model benefits: (1) Simplicity and flexibility - easy for customers to evolve subscriptions, (2) Faster growth - reduces commitment barrier, quicker customer acquisition, (3) More lucrative - higher per-month cost (accounts for churn risk), more cash over time with good retention, (4) Reduced barrier to entry - friendlier pricing for small customers, (5) Investor appeal - quick customer base growth looks good, but higher churn (17% vs 15% for annual) creates unpredictable revenue. Annual model benefits: (1) Increased investment capital - entire year's revenue upfront for reinvestment, (2) Higher customer retention - at least one year commitment, customers more invested, (3) More opportunities for loyalty - builds more committed customer base despite longer sales cycle and higher CAC, (4) Increased convenience and customer savings - procurement once per year, prepaid savings, (5) Revenue predictability - stable, predictable revenue appeals to investors, clearer cash flow picture. Revenue recognition importance: Critical for business intelligence, corporate taxes, ASC 606 compliance, customer reimbursements (especially annual), investor transparency, going public requirements. Deferred revenue is a liability, not asset - accurate visibility essential. Key data: SaaS contracts <1 year have 17% churn vs 15% for annual. Monthly model best for: startups seeking rapid acquisition, low commitment barriers, price-sensitive customers, strong customer success teams. Annual model best for: established businesses, proven value props, enterprise customers, longer sales cycles. Hybrid approach (both monthly and annual) maximizes addressable market. No one-size-fits-all - depends on target market, growth stage, retention ability, revenue predictability needs, sales/customer success capabilities.

### RICE: Simple Prioritization for Product Managers

- **Source:** Intercom Blog
- **Author:** Sean McBride
- **URL:** https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Reading Time:** 7 minutes
- **Key Concepts:** Product prioritization, RICE framework, roadmap planning, product management, reach, impact, confidence, effort, scoring systems
- **Key Insight:** RICE is a scoring framework for prioritizing product work that combines four factors: Reach (how many people will this impact per time period), Impact (how much will this impact each person - 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal), Confidence (how confident are you in estimates - 100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low), and Effort (person-months required). Formula: RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort. The resulting score measures "total impact per time worked" - exactly what you want to maximize. Why prioritization is difficult: (1) Satisfying to work on pet ideas you'd use yourself vs projects with broad reach, (2) Tempting to focus on clever ideas vs projects that directly impact goals, (3) Exciting to dive into new ideas vs projects you're confident about, (4) Easy to discount additional effort. Framework helps avoid these biases and consistently compare projects. Key principles: Use real measurements from product metrics for Reach (don't pull numbers from hat), be honest about Confidence (avoid decision paralysis with multiple-choice scale), estimate Effort as person-months (rough estimates with whole numbers or 0.5), Impact uses multiple-choice scale to avoid "tangled mess of gut feeling". After scoring, sort and re-evaluate - reconsider estimates if scores seem wrong, accept gut instinct may be wrong. RICE shouldn't be hard and fast rule - dependencies, table stakes features, or other factors may require working on lower-scored projects first, but framework helps identify when making trade-offs. Framework helps make better-informed decisions and defend them to others. Examples provided for each factor showing how to calculate Reach (450, 2000, 800 customers per quarter), assign Impact scores (3, 1, 2), Confidence scores (100%, 80%, 50%), and Effort scores (2, 4, 1 person-months).

### My Billion Dollar Mistake

- **Source:** Product Habits
- **Author:** Hiten Shah (Co-founder of KISSmetrics)
- **URL:** https://producthabits.com/my-billion-dollar-mistake/
- **Date:** 2018
- **Key Concepts:** Product prioritization, focus, process, execution speed, competitor analysis, drive-by management, Hiten Bombs, product-market fit, customer research, team alignment
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive case study of how KISSmetrics, despite having a 3-year head start on the analytics market and achieving product-market fit, lost their billion-dollar opportunity. Early failures: Built products for Facebook Application Developers who couldn't pay, then built business intelligence tool requiring too much customization. Pivot that worked: Talked to Google Analytics users, identified online marketers as target market (willing to pay, needed conversion data), built MVP addressing their pain points (funnel reports, real-time debugging, user-level data). Success: Hundreds of signups per week, word-of-mouth, industry standard features, 3-year market lead. The "Hiten Bomb" problem: Daily/weekly random ideas dropped on team without framework or filter - new features, competitor-inspired ideas, investor/advisor suggestions, single customer requests. Impact: Team rushed to execute, lost confidence in leadership, stopped listening, needed internal memo to explain behavior. Root cause: No process to prioritize what to work on and why, everyone doing whatever they thought was right. What great leaders do: Consistent direction, filter inputs, remove distractions, focus resources, align team on priorities. Competitor failures: Ignored Mixpanel (mobile focus, freemium strategy, site badges, $77M raised vs KISSmetrics $25M), missed "why" behind real-time debugger (eye candy for sales demos), ignored Heap (simple API, 6,000 customers, $40M raised). Key lesson: Speed matters - can't capture market once, must do it repeatedly faster than competitors. Lost magic: Forgot process that built initial success, went back to bad habits, stalled for 3 years allowing competitors to catch up. Solution: Create product processes that produce repeatable wins based on continuous innovation, focus, planning, unbiased research, goal-focused development. Key mistakes: Building for customers who couldn't pay, requiring too much customization, making educated guesses instead of researched conclusions, no prioritization framework, drive-by management, ignoring competitors instead of learning from them, losing execution speed as team grew, forgetting successful process.

### Prioritization as a Superpower

- **Source:** next big thing (Substack)
- **Author:** Nikhil Basu Trivedi (Venture Capitalist)
- **URL:** https://nbt.substack.com/p/prioritization-as-a-superpower
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Prioritization, leadership, founder traits, VC evaluation, startup success, decision-making, time management, resource allocation
- **Key Insight:** From a VC perspective, prioritization is a fundamental superpower for evaluating founders and CEOs. Especially true in startups where prioritization is everything - many things to do, limited time and resources. Figuring out what to say yes to, what to say no to, timing and sequencing can be the difference-maker between good vs. great vs. exceptional company. Best leaders constantly prioritize by: (1) Sensing right time to tack, change courses, re-prioritize, (2) Communicating with team to ensure everyone understands what and why, especially in times of change, aligned with clarity, (3) Operating with serious urgency when something is at top of list, (4) Delicately balancing near-term vs. long-term priorities, (5) Knowing what needs to be perfect vs. what's fine leaving imperfect to move on, (6) Achieving or exceeding goals. Context on founder traits: Paul Graham lists five (Determination, Flexibility, Imagination, Naughtiness, Friendship), Entrepreneur First lists four (Smart, Skilled, Insightful, Committed), Footwork looks for three (Hungry and humble, Know business inside and out, Magnets for talent). But most successful leaders are outliers who break rules, so prioritization ability cuts through the noise. Key question: "What are you doing to hone it, today?"

### It Just Doesn't Matter

- **URL:** https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/it_just_doesnt_matter
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product design, simplicity, feature prioritization, knowing what to leave out, design philosophy, minimalism
- **Key Insight:** "Because it just doesn't matter" embodies what makes a product great. Figuring out what matters and leaving out the rest. Best designers and programmers aren't the ones with best skills or nimblest fingers, they are the ones that can determine what just doesn't matter - that's where real gains are made. Most time spent is wasted on things that don't matter. Examples from Campfire: 5-minute timestamps vs every line (doesn't matter 95% of time), no bold/italic formatting (CAPS or asterisks work, don't require software/support/learning curve), no total people count in room (names listed, doesn't change behavior). Would these be nice/great/cool? Sure. But do they really matter? Nope. Philosophy: "We are the audience. We build tools for ourselves." Then put them out for others who think like us. Design for 90% of the time, don't care about other 10%. Solve most common use cases, leave complex ones to others. Key insight: "A good product is not perfect if you cannot add any more - it is perfect if you can't take anything more out of it." Cut out work and thinking that doesn't matter to achieve productivity you've never imagined.

### Backlog Size and Customer Conversations

- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Backlog management, customer conversations, product development, MVP iteration, UI design, technical debt, session replay, account spoofing, customer observation, NPS, word-of-mouth marketing
- **Key Insight:** Practical lessons from a year building event/ticket management startup (tens of thousands tickets sold). Core principle: "The size of your backlog is inversely proportional to how often you talk to customers." Replace planning time with talking to customers - the what should come from customer, planning time should focus on how to build. Large backlogs = high unvalidated assumptions, low customer value. More proxies between developer and customer = less product meets customer needs. Reduce UI design time, focus on technical component design - basic UI 60% right is enough, hone through feedback. Product's capacity to implement UI feedback more important than initial UI. Small components and low-level reusability key. Speed is function of technical debt. Observe customers using app (PostHog session replay) - qualitative complements quantitative. Hyrum's Law corollary: "What you intend to be not clickable will be clicked." Implement account spoofing for admin to use app as specific production user - makes testing/diagnosis easy, reduces test data need. Page one real estate critical - most relevant info, sparse content. If user reaching for menu on page one, UI is wrong. Customer is most important marketer - NPS indicates if customers stake reputation. Better to have 100 people love you than million sort of like you (Brian Chesky). Focus on smaller set of happy, referring customers vs casting wider net. MVPs pointless without iteration - not excuse for poor experience, but to answer: (1) Enough customer value to continue? (2) What technical improvements needed for scale? (3) Makes dent in key goals or distraction? These questions can't be answered without shipping to production.

### Don't Trust Agile Alone

- **Source:** UI Patterns
- **Author:** Anders Toxboe
- **URL:** https://ui-patterns.com/blog/dont-trust-agile-alone-to-build-successful-products
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Agile development, Scrum, product discovery, experimentation, search mode vs execution mode, hill chart, backlog management, validation, desirability, viability, feasibility
- **Key Insight:** "We are all doing high-frequency waterfall. Agile won't save us." Teams stuck in Design, Build, Ship without testing if ideas are good. Agile originally about reducing uncertainty and maximizing learning, but today often becomes high-frequency waterfall. Scrum/XP fail to ask "why" - all ceremonies focus on when, how, and what, not why. Cannot eliminate uncertainty by building backlog - creates tunnel vision focusing on what and when without asking why. Need to do more than thinking - thinking about implementation ≠ doing actual work to figure out best solution. Ryan Singer's hill chart: need uphill work (discovery) before downhill execution. Two modes: (1) Execution mode - planning why failure not option, focus on development velocity, efficiency, (2) Search mode - experimentation, failure embraced, focus on learning velocity. Better to get stuck with 1-2 person experimentation team than 10-person development team. In search mode, validate three areas through experimentation: (1) Desirable - target segment has problem, solution is good fit (comprehension tests, fake door testing, single-feature products, video demo, Wizard of Oz), (2) Viable - desired effect on business (dry wallet, collect pre-orders, sell the future, high hurdle), (3) Feasible - can build it (development spikes, working prototypes, single-feature products, move in with customer). Need to acknowledge discovery work early - significant work searching for right solution, eliminating uncertainty, before executing plan. When confident solution is desired, viable, and feasible, team can trust work will ship and have planned effect.

### Building Products: A Framework

- **Author:** Julie Zhuo (Former VP of Product Design at Facebook)
- **URL:** https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/building-products-91aa93bea4bb
- **Date:** 2025
- **Reading Time:** 7 minutes
- **Key Concepts:** Product development, problem framing, execution, measuring success, metrics, team dynamics, product management, hypothesis testing, product-market fit
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive framework for building great products based on lessons from Facebook. Four main areas: (1) On Framing: Product succeeds because it solves problem for people - single most important thing. First step: understand what problem to solve and for whom, crystal clear before thinking about solutions. Second question: why is this problem worth solving? Narrowly-defined audience (that you're part of) = can rely on intuition; otherwise rely on research/data. Startups: easier to go after narrowly-defined audience first, expand later. Problem should be easy to communicate in sentence or two, resonate with target audience. (2) Execution: Good execution = getting to believable conclusions in shortest time. Bad execution = fail without learning why, or take year to learn what could be learned in 3 months. What separates teams isn't whether they fail (guaranteed) but how well they consistently execute. Go broad before deep - brainstorm 10, 20, 50 solutions before picking winner. First 5 ideas are obvious; creativity in 11th, 20th, 50th idea. If someone asks "have you considered X?" and answer is "No" = red flag exploration not rigorous enough. Use empirical evidence to narrow down ideas. Frame solution as hypothesis. Constantly look for ways to short-circuit vetting hypothesis (run idea by people, surveys, quick versions). Positive signal on hypothesis doesn't mean rush to ship - separate decision on bar for full launch vs. test. Split big projects into smaller, independently testable milestones. Do team post-mortem after every project. (3) Measuring Success: How you measure success is critical - people rally around it. Define success metrics before launch (avoid confirmation bias). For each success metric, come up with counter metric to avoid plugging one hole with another. If metric moves unexpectedly, first question should be "why?" Use Crystal Ball technique: "If I could know anything about how people use product, what would tell me if it's successful?" Work backwards from abstract answer to measurable metric. Goals should be set with best current information - adjust if new information changes understanding. If don't understand/agree with how team measures success, bring up right away. Constant debates about product direction = probably disagreement in measuring success. For product-market fit, goal on retention rather than engagement or # of users. (4) Team Dynamics: Think in terms of "what helps team be successful" not role expectations. Teams that fall in love with problem > teams that fall in love with particular solutions. Always assume best intentions. Understand what you're uniquely good at and what teammates are good at - divvy up responsibilities accordingly. Good communication key - everyone should feel safe expressing viewpoints, even contrarian. Diversity of opinions = best results.

### Scaling Product Delivery: The "Dirty" Secret of High Performing Product Teams

- **Source:** Reforge Blog
- **Authors:** Andrew Johns (Former President and VP of Product and Growth at Wealthfront, founding partner of Unusual Ventures, early employee at Facebook, Twitter, and Quora) and Matt Greenberg (CTO at Reforge, Former VP Eng at Credit Karma)
- **URL:** https://www.reforge.com/blog/scaling-product-delivery
- **Key Concepts:** Product delivery, scaling, big bets, waterfall vs agile, product execution, career progression, product strategy, team systems, tradeoff decisions
- **Key Insight:** "The dirty secret of Silicon Valley is that most great product teams follow a system that resembles waterfall (gasp!) to launch new innovative features or products repeatedly." System starts with high conviction based on judgment, intuition, and instinct rather than iterative customer feedback. Companies need to ship big bets over and over to create step changes. Agile/Lean don't enable shipping big bets repeatably, lead to less willingness to take big swings, fail when companies need step function change. High-performing teams don't religiously subscribe to one tool - recognize different problems require different tools. Gradient of execution (career progression): Maintain enhancement → Evolve feature → Evolve group of features → Launch something new end-to-end. Many get stuck at steps 3-4 due to: (1) Grey area grows - more ambiguity, leaders bogged down in "right" answer vs fast/reasonable solutions, (2) Multiple teams/sequences - influence needs to move from explicit to implicit. Continuous big bets drive company growth - every dimension faces headwinds (CAC going up, target market decreasing, adjacent users, competition increasing, law of large numbers). Two types of bets: (1) Raising existing ceiling - innovative features within existing use cases, (2) Creating new ceiling - new adjacent products/use cases. Common breaking points: Series B+ (have resources but no system), Series D+ (need to expand product portfolio). Messy path from strategic idea to outcome - uncertainty, risks, misalignment, cannibalization derail execution. Signals of unscalable execution: Late-stage blow-ups (exec gaps between idea and reality), Eng+Product grows but output doesn't, endless tradeoff debates, growth slows despite rapid iteration, shift in customer feedback from asking for more to complaining. Root causes: (1) No system - teams build through different methods, stuck in small iterative bets, (2) Wrong system - applying Agile to large-scale work, forcing company-specific systems, (3) "Wrong people" - no unicorn saves you, wrong system = same outcome, (4) Over-relying on superstars - unreliable scaling, need to deconstruct/institutionalize what creates superstar. Keys to delivery at scale: (1) Build specific system for large product bets - 4 types of product work (Feature, Growth, Scaling, PMF Expansion), can't use same system for iterative work, (2) Manage complexity don't remove it - agile inspiration not religion (short timelines to prototypes, accept new insights), tolerance for misfires, deliberate tradeoff framework, codified checkpoints with specific purposes, (3) Communicate the system - "why" matters, engage teams in creating method, (4) Know and customize to superpower - tailor to business/customer/market, mold atomic units, pick one part as superpower (e.g., Amazon Press Release, Airbnb 7 Star Review).

### Effective Product Management

- **Author:** Craig McLuckie (VP of Product Management, VMware)
- **URL:** https://cmcluck.medium.com/effective-product-management-8021831a184
- **Date:** 2025
- **Reading Time:** 13 minutes
- **Key Concepts:** Product management discipline, business centricity, technical versatility, customer empathy, collaboration, storytelling, courage, positivity, relentlessness, discipline, influence without authority, product-engineering relationship, anti-patterns
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive guide to effective product management from VP perspective. Core philosophy: Product management's primary allegiance is to the business - engineering builds technology, product management ensures it generates sustainable business. "PMs as CEOs" mindset can be detrimental in large orgs - PMs don't have CEO empowerment, role is influence not direct authority. Great PMs represent people not in room, light up teams, excellent storytellers who connect teams viscerally to problems. Key virtues: (1) Business centricity - bridge to business, understand sales/financials (top line + bottom line), balance risk/reward, know when something isn't aligned. (2) Technical versatility - understand product deeply, have in-depth customer tech conversations, appreciate engineering practices. "Not getting the tech is like being a barista that doesn't drink coffee." Install and use your technology. (3) Customer empathy - channel customer in hundreds of decisions, big difference between prospective user vs buyer, serve both, beware survivor bias. (4) Collaboration - no team is island, local optimum ≠ global optimum, avoid zero-sum thinking, key elements: building trust, clear communication, honoring trust. (5) Storytelling/Communications - every PM is leader, create sense of potential before it exists, inward-facing critical (get engineers to understand customer problem/business imperatives), manage signal-to-noise ratio ("fog of war" is enemy), think "who needs to know?". (6) Courage/Positivity/Relentlessness - courage: make decisions, accept downside, say no (harder than yes). Positivity: focus on opportunity, remove heat. Relentlessness: 3 steps forward, 2 steps back world. (7) Discipline - grind quotient exists, be reliable, disciplined about priorities. What works well: Knowledge is primary currency (influence without authority), know when spinning wheels and get help, embrace kind directness (Radical Candor), shared fate mindset (one team with engineering), learning mindset (learning machine, celebrate bumps), see bigger machine (willing to cut own product if doesn't fit bigger story). Anti-patterns: "That is beneath me" (ego useless, nothing beneath PM, but don't make it your job), wallpapering over organizational gaps (hiding problems from org), disagree then dig in (disagree+commit but re-examine with data, frame as experiment), passive aggressive PM/eng death spiral (perfect PRD useless if unread, classic sign: quick features get universe-estimates), being Mary Poppins to engineering (PM is strategy/business function, not execution, healthy tension not insulation), saying yes to everything (product defined more by nos than yeses, be practical and call your shot).

### Top 10 Reasons for Slow Velocity

- **Source:** SVPG (Silicon Valley Product Group)
- **Author:** Marty Cagan
- **URL:** https://www.svpg.com/top-10-reasons-for-slow-velocity/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product velocity, slow delivery, organizational bottlenecks, product ownership, project management, release cycles, product discovery, UX design, product vision, dedicated teams, technical debt, architecture, team coordination
- **Key Insight:** Diagnostic framework for why product teams move slowly. Most organizations blame developer skills, but root causes are typically organizational/structural: (1) Lack of strong product owners - largest single reason, causes churn and morale issues. (2) Lack of strong project management - second biggest reason, need dedicated PM/ScrumMaster who is "pushy but not bossy" to remove impediments. (3) Infrequent release cycles - need releases no less frequently than every two weeks, requires regression test automation and release automation. (4) Not including lead engineers in discovery - need key participants from day 1 to contribute faster alternative approaches, prevents late-stage churn. (5) Not utilizing UX design in discovery - UX should be completed before items hit backlog, defined "pixel perfect," prevents waiting for designs/assets and "feed the beast." (6) Lack of product vision and focus - rapidly shifting roadmap/priorities cause churn, need clear big picture vision. (7) Lack of dedicated teams - treating engineers like chess pieces prevents expertise building and team relationships needed for velocity. (8) Lack of dedicated rapid response team - same teams doing sustaining/escalations and forward progress causes interruptions, need separate rapid response team. (9) Inflexible architecture/technical debt - architecture doesn't facilitate rapid evolution, must be attacked ongoing (can't fix overnight). (10) Missing holistic view - teams don't understand what others are doing and how parts fit together, causes thrashing/churn due to unclear dependencies/inter-relationships. Good news: each can be addressed. However, velocity less important than releasing good software that makes difference for business.

### 50 Short Product Lessons

- **Source:** Cutlefish Blog
- **Author:** John Cutler
- **URL:** https://cutle.fish/blog/50-product-lessons
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product development, bets, opportunities, interventions, premature convergence, missions, projects, starting together, coherence, operating models, data, measurement, chronic vs acute issues, short-term thinking, velocity, storytelling, strategy, prioritization, learning cadence, learned helplessness, feature factories, customer connection, iteration, decision-making, deadlines, forcing functions, dependencies, temporary products, vocabulary, reflection
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive collection of 50 short, conversational product lessons covering the full spectrum of product development. Key themes include: (1) Thinking in bets - portfolios of bets of different sizes and durations, communicating bets to new team members, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches. (2) Opportunities vs interventions - framing work as opportunities and temporary interventions rather than permanent problems/solutions, enables incremental value capture. (3) Premature convergence - danger of converging on solutions too early, intuition drives early convergence, right time is "a little later than comfortable," look for period of messiness. (4) Missions vs projects - missions are open-ended, nested, have stopping functions vs predetermined definition of done, longer missions suggest value. (5) Starting together - limit planning inventory, get whole team experiencing problem for first time together (haunted house analogy), clear calendars for kickoff. (6) Coherence and messy middle - difficulty connecting low-level work to larger bets, need to keep reiterating bets in 1-3 quarter range, coherence ≠ certainty, manufacturing certainty limits coherence. (7) Multiple operating models - need different approaches for different types of bets, avoid one-size-fits-all process, higher-performing teams have stable patterns while absorbing unique work. (8) Data as trust proxy - data won't settle all disagreements, effective teams have more uncertainty, adopt learning stance, measurement is catalyst for learning not pass/fail. (9) Chronic vs acute issues - difference is self-repair ability, successful companies prevent chronic issues, immune system approach, variety in how achieved. (10) Short-term thinking - balancing act, be stubborn about long-term, compress activity durations, sense early indicators. (11) Time to get good - 12-18 months for full onboarding, requires repetition and practice, allow failure, psychological safety. (12) Play less Tetris - PMs loading up teams like Tetris, keeps people busy but prevents experimentation, over-constrains plans. (13) Moving fast and slow - bias for frequent integration + longer-term thinking, harmonize learning and shipping. (14) Storytelling - high-performing teams tell coherent stories with depth, discuss assumptions/learnings/surprises, practice reflection muscle. (15) Strategy and beliefs - "Which wave are you riding?", map core beliefs about industry direction, position relative to legacy/disruptors/competitors. (16) Prioritizing opportunities - value/effort framework is too simplistic, prioritize by opportunity size, resist premature breakdown of solutions. (17) Learning cadence - differentiate from shipping cadence, ask about Aha moments, learning velocity reveals team effectiveness, importance of acting on learning. (18) Learned helplessness - teams adapt to overly prescriptive PMs, engineers check out after being burned, need psychological safety. (19) Data snacking vs integrated - cherry-picking vs weaving data into all facets, consistent language around bets, common thread across reviews. (20) Functional feature factories - middle category (4-7 impact), chugging along but no 10s, lack step changes. (21) Teams closer to customers - "How long to get customer on phone?", remove proxies, connect problem solvers directly with humans, behavioral data + qualitative in tandem. (22) One pagers - flexible formats, checklists not requirements, don't force estimates for opportunity-focused bets. (23) Leaving time to iterate - teams scared without iteration time, frame missions with stopping functions, balance flexibility with confidence. (24) PMs creating environment - "best decisions happen reasonably quickly", not sole decider, create context for independent decisions, balance speed/quality. (25) Two priority levels - extremely valuable + experimentation-friendly OR reasonably valuable + guaranteed small, avoid medium-value trap. (26) Artificial deadlines - real deadline = value drops precipitously if missed, admit artificial deadlines, use cost of delay instead. (27) Forcing functions - healthy functions snap out of automatic thought (sprints, time boxes, customer exposure), definition from HCI glossary. (28) Measurement to inform decisions - measure what reduces uncertainty for decisions you need to make, not what competitors measure or for pass/fail. (29) Reflection is what counts - create projections at kickoff, revisit periodically, regular decision reviews, avoid revisionist history. (30) Shared understanding/vocabulary - always harder than you think, words like sprint/vision/MVP misunderstood, debate is what matters not single definition. (31) Products/features temporary - delivery mechanisms are temporary, knowledge of value exchange persists, teams around value streams not technology.

### Simple Product Management Tricks

- **Source:** Jacob Kaplan-Moss Blog
- **Author:** Jacob Kaplan-Moss
- **URL:** https://jacobian.org/2021/oct/20/simple-pm-tricks/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product management, prioritization, effort/impact analysis, timeboxing, estimation, automation, playbooks, planning, backlog management
- **Key Insight:** Three simple, practical product management techniques for non-PMs who need to wear a product hat: (1) Effort/Impact Analysis - technique for long-term planning using 3x3 matrix mapping difficulty (horizontal) against impact (vertical). Fast and loose approach - don't worry about precise definitions. Upper-left (high impact, low effort) = obvious wins. Bottom-right (low impact, high effort) = obvious no's. Pick items from middle based on appetite. Remarkably effective at getting team agreement on work set quickly. Learned from Craig Kerstiens at Heroku. (2) Timebox Hard-to-Estimate Work - for work with huge unknowns (e.g., legacy migrations where unknowns dominate timeline, impossible to know upfront what tasks required). Solution: timeboxing - pick arbitrary length of time (week or two), see how far you get. At end, have more knowledge, review progress, make better-informed decisions. Powerful because approaches estimation differently - instead of "how long will X take?" asks "what can we do in two weeks?". Also useful for projects that can't be completed in reasonable time (e.g., massive bug backlog - untenable to drive to zero, but one day a week might be fine). Great for making progress despite mountains of work or significant unknowns. (3) Write Playbooks Before Automation - automation isn't always slam-dunk we think. We know automation isn't necessarily easy, but process is complex/error-prone/messy. Playbooks as middle ground - instead of doing nothing or diving into code, first write playbook (set of instructions/recipe). Be as specific as possible, include code/shell commands for copy-paste. Gets closer to automation goals (consistency, repeatability, reliability) at fraction of effort. If later decide automation worth it, playbook serves as detailed specification for code.

### Product-Driven versus Customer-Driven

- **Source:** Ribbonfarm
- **Author:** Venkatesh Rao
- **URL:** https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/04/24/product-driven-versus-customer-driven/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product-driven businesses, customer-driven businesses, product strategy, business philosophy, Lean Startup critique, Steve Jobs, innovation, market creation, disruption, anomie, authoritah, True Auteur North, MVP, pivot, pattern recognition, new-game assumption
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive framework distinguishing two fundamentally different approaches to building businesses. Product-driven businesses develop visions inside-out, create customers and wealth by selling structure into anomie (undefined restless energy), require an "indispensable asshole at the top" who is an instrument of "what technology wants," and expand markets absolutely. Customer-driven businesses develop visions outside-in through pattern recognition, steal rather than create customers (wealth redistribution, not creation), assume stable behaviors that don't change, and operate in zero-sum or negative-sum ways. Key distinctions: (1) Product-driven is NOT auteur-driven (singular vision within limited scope), itch-driven (personal convenience sampling), or formalism-driven (codified processes replacing asshole). (2) Cannot hybridize - attempts like Lean Startup create "visioning-process debt" where inside-out and outside-in drives eventually conflict. The pivot is insufficient to resolve this. (3) Product-driven sells structure (experience structure) while customer-driven sells happiness/solutions to existing patterns. (4) The "new-game assumption" - product-driven is better now because old economy is seizing up (stealing customers harder), new economy keeps growing. Question: boundless frontier (secular change) vs cyclic (50-70 year cycles, back to customer-driven in 30-50 years). Examples: Apple (P) vs Microsoft (C), Pixar (P) vs Dreamworks (C), Google (P) vs Samsung (C), Facebook (P) vs LinkedIn (C). Edge cases: Amazon and Elon Musk appear customer-driven but are product-driven (disruption is side-effect, TAN lies in new markets). Answers: build product-driven (easier to find money), cannot transform (DNA), product-driven is better (for now), identify by indispensable asshole at top aligned to TAN, suits winners/product-driven personalities, cannot hybridize (no-man's-land), don't listen to customers (they don't exist yet if product-driven).

### How to Develop Product Sense

- **Source:** Lenny's Newsletter
- **Author:** Jules Walter (Guest author; Product Leader at Google Gemini, previously at YouTube and Slack)
- **URL:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/product-sense
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product sense, PM skills, empathy, creativity, user research, product observation, product deconstruction, learning from product thinkers, technology trends, user behavior
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive practical guide to developing product sense, which is the skill of consistently crafting products (or making changes) that have the intended impact on users. Product sense relies on empathy (discover meaningful user needs) and creativity (solutions that effectively address those needs). Four practices: (1) Observe people interacting with products - repeatedly observe people using products (yours or others), attend user research sessions, pay attention to micro details, ask open-ended questions. Key questions: "What do you think the purpose of this product is?", "What actions do you want to take?", "What are you thinking right now? How does that make you feel?". Five lessons: people are time-crunched/distracted (pick right defaults, make primary actions obvious), drop out when confused/nervous (unambiguous labels), don't give too much info at once (Slack pricing example - dropdowns increased purchases), context impacts decisions (comparisons, social proof), make goals/actions clear (Slack onboarding experiment increased retention). (2) Deconstruct everyday products - observe yourself using products (1-2 hours/month), use questions from Julie Zhuo's product critique framework, compare products in same category (Cash App vs Venmo example - different strategies), observe own reactions (frustration and delight moments), meditation helps improve observation skills. (3) Learn from great product thinkers - attend product reviews, take notes, look for patterns in questions/feedback, understand mental checklists and principles. Example: Stewart Butterfield at Slack - "The details are not the details. They make the design." (rooster @channel warning example), understand problems and frame them with strong constraints (streamlines decision-making). If don't work at company with great thinkers: find external mentors, read articles/interviews (Julie Zhuo, Stewart Butterfield, David Lieb, Rahul Vohra), ask questions about prompts, decision points, alternative approaches, surprising insights, principles/frameworks. (4) Be curious about technology and domain - learn about emerging trends (technology, society, regulations). Examples: Cash App + Bitcoin (76% revenue), Uber (smartphones/GPS/Google Maps APIs), Clubhouse (pandemic). Track macro trends (platform shifts - web3/AR/VR/AI, social shifts - remote work, regulations - privacy laws) and micro changes (Figma + WebGL example). Keep open mind, ask "If this trend reaches full potential, what opportunities will it create?" Keep up via developer conferences, industry analysts (Ben Thompson), Twitter (Naval, Elad Gil, Balaji), invest/advise startups or follow top VCs. Meet engineers/domain experts for micro changes. As Paul Graham said: "Live in the future, then build what's missing." Signs of improvement: notice subtle things (micro frustrations/delights), anticipate non-obvious problems, develop higher-quality hypotheses, contribute unique insights, be right more often about impact on metrics, get positive feedback. Additional practice: actively reflect on product sense loop (identify assumptions, construct experiments, analyze outcomes, reflect on right/wrong, repeat). If assumptions proven more frequently (e.g., 2/10 to 8/10), product sense improving. Resources: Tony Fadell TED talk, Marty Cagan's "Inspired", Don Norman course.

### Speed Generates Quality

- **Source:** Medium (Jason Yip)
- **Author:** Jason Yip (Senior Manager Product Engineering at Grainger; ex-Spotify, ex-ThoughtWorks, ex-CruiseControl)
- **URL:** https://jchyip.medium.com/guiding-principle-speed-generates-quality-f0672db3e4bc
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product development, speed, quality, learning loops, iteration, organizational learning, velocity, agility
- **Key Insight:** Counterintuitive guiding principle: speed in learning generates quality, not the other way around. The ceramics teacher story: teacher divided class into two groups - "quantity" group graded on weight of pots produced (50 lbs = A), "quality" group graded on single perfect pot. Result: highest quality work came from quantity group. Why? Quantity group was churning out work and learning from mistakes, while quality group sat theorizing about perfection and had little to show. Core principle: Speed creates more opportunities for learning; learning generates quality. Mistake is believing that being more careful, taking longer, creates quality - sub-optimal because certain knowledge can only be acquired by releasing and making contact with the problem. This isn't mindless speed ("move fast and break things") but rather shortening learning loops. Learning faster is not about rushing; it's about making things safer and smoother. Key distinction: Smooth from perspective of "baton" (the work) ≠ smooth from perspective of "runner" (the worker). Smooth from perspective of baton has more impact on organizational learning speed. Two approaches: (1) Quality first - "be very careful," "do it right the first time," "people need to love first version" - leads to theorizing, little output, misses learning. (2) Speed first - "shorten learning loop," "make sure failure doesn't kill us" - produces iterations, learns from mistakes, generates better quality. Implications: Don't optimize for perfect first version, optimize for fast learning cycles. Create safety so failures don't kill you. Focus on smooth flow of work through system, not just individual speed. Fastest path to quality is through many cycles of learning, not careful planning of single attempt.

### Musk's 5-Step Design Process

- **Source:** ModelThinkers
- **Author:** Elon Musk (via interview with Everyday Astronaut)
- **URL:** https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/musks-5-step-design-process
- **Date:** Unknown (interview date)
- **Key Concepts:** Design process, engineering efficiency, requirements, simplification, optimization, cycle time, automation, first principles, lean thinking
- **Key Insight:** Systematic 5-step design process that SpaceX aims to "apply rigorously" for efficient engineering and product development. The 5 steps (must be done in order): (1) Make the requirements less dumb - "your requirements are definitely dumb, it does not matter who gave them to you." Question the question. Requirements from "smart person" often most dangerous because you might not question them enough. Similar to Framestorming. (2) Delete the part or process - "If you're not adding things back in at least 10% of the time, you're clearly not deleting enough." Start lean, build up when required. Bias is to add things "in case" but you can make "in case" arguments for many things. Each requirement/constraint must be accountable to person, not department. Example: SpaceX grid fins didn't need to fold back - eliminated need for massive mechanisms. (3) Simplify or optimize the design - "Possibly the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist." Must work through first two steps before optimizing. Engineers need holistic view. Example: Engineers invested in reducing rocket engine weight but hadn't addressed reducing payload weight equivalently. (4) Accelerate cycle time - "If you're digging your grave, don't dig faster." Embrace speed but only after steps 1-3 ensure right direction. Accelerated Agile approach, but only after first three steps satisfied. (5) Automate - Don't automate before earlier points addressed. Tesla Model 3 battery mat story: invested massive time/effort to automate process before asking what mat was for - discovered it was no longer required (created to reduce sound but unnecessary). Order is critical - must work through steps 1-3 before accelerating/automating. Can be applied to UX, marketing campaigns, product design. Reflects First Principle Thinking, Framestorming, Occam's Razor, Lean Startup/MVP (Musk refers to "Minimum Viable Rocket"). Rejects adding features "in case." Limitations: May need to cycle back and forth in complex applications as requirements are uncovered or refined.

### As a User, I Don't Want To (Inverted User Stories)

- **Source:** UX Collective (Medium)
- **Author:** Pavel Samsonov
- **URL:** https://uxdesign.cc/as-a-user-i-dont-want-to-973990a30158
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** User stories, product development, user experience, value vs cost, product complexity, feature bloat, product management, agile, scrum, innovation
- **Key Insight:** Task-oriented user stories lead to bad product decisions because they mix up value with cost. Original user story format: "As [user] I want [to reach a goal] so that I can [obtain a benefit]" - focused on goal and benefit. Degenerated into task-oriented: "As [user] I want [to do a task] so that I can [use the tool]" - focuses on work. Examples of corrupted stories: "I want to click the button so that I can see the page," "I want to enter my email so that I can receive exclusive offers," "As a user, I want to log in" (missing "so that"). The truth: users don't want to use a product at all - ideal experience is reaching goal without doing any work. Original format outlined benefit users might pay for, team figures out how to provide benefit and costs. But tasks, tools, and features are NOT benefits - they are costs users pay to achieve goal. Adding features degrades experience by increasing cost. With physical products, users have way out when complexity exceeds value. With software, they just leave. Task-oriented stories obfuscate lack of value - "as a user, I want to fill out the form" fools team into thinking user will give product something for nothing. Cost is hidden because user is defined as someone who wants to fill out forms, even if no such person exists. With stories like that, every ticket becomes self-justifying. Features multiply, complexity rises, value plummets, but teams can't see it. Solution: Invert the user story. Task-oriented story contains useful information: what it calls benefit is actually the cost, what it calls goal is solution hypothesis. Example: "As a user, I want to customize my toolbar so that I can optimize my browsing experience" becomes "As a user, I want to optimize my browsing experience without having to customize my toolbar." This shifts focus from task to desired outcome, highlights feature as hypothesis needing validation, encourages innovation, reduces complexity. Working backwards: Task-oriented stories capture existing patterns that are obvious - if benefit brings obvious feature to mind, it probably exists elsewhere as cost. Existing cost is great place to find pain points. Amazon approach: "today, customers have to..." - "Today, customers have to customize the toolbar if they want to improve their browsing experience" sounds like struggle, not feature to build. Inverting stories turns rush to add ticket into opportunity to innovate and differentiate. Key takeaways: Original focused on goals/benefits, task-oriented focuses on work/tools, tasks/features are costs not benefits, invert by changing "I want to do X" to "I want Y without having to do X," reveals real goal and highlights assumptions, opens better solution space.

### Startups Don't Need Product Managers Who Are Visionaries (Street Sweeper PM)

- **Source:** VentureBeat
- **Author:** Jon Sadow (Cofounder and Chief Product Officer at Scoop; previously at Google)
- **URL:** https://venturebeat.com/entrepreneur/startups-dont-need-product-managers-who-are-visionaries
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Product management, startup PM, visionary vs facilitator, street sweeper, prioritization, MVP, embracing what you don't know, team relationships, hiring product managers
- **Key Insight:** Counterintuitive perspective: startups don't need product managers striving to be visionaries. Maximum benefit comes from someone who focuses less on glamour/invention and more on empowering teams to build most impactful product possible. Core of great PM: clearing path for everyone else on team to set them up for success. Four key practices: (1) Be a street sweeper - focus on mundane but critical tasks. Example: International product rollout at Google required focusing on finance law, translation services, font size details for different languages rather than exciting international travel. Without mundane conversations about font size or finance law, product never would have launched. When managers dream up next great product, they often aren't addressing mundane but critical tasks. Refusal to sweep street (or belief they're above it) leads to ineffective processes, delayed development/deployment. (2) Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize - example of feature development where team initially wanted full vision with bells and whistles. Realized needed street sweeper mentality: clear road of complicated capabilities, prioritize simplest version. Visionary approach would never have launched - would prioritize idea rather than MVP. Visionary PMs drawn to revolutionary/idyllic rather than evolutionary. Must be comfortable asking what's most important, prioritizing necessary less-flashy capabilities, accepting iterative rollout/slimmer product. (3) Embrace what you don't know - PMs come from technical or non-technical backgrounds, can polarize dissonance. Example: Technical PM writing code instead of facilitating slowed development, poor resource use, suggests air of knowing better. Visionary PM might feel they have all answers. How well manager fills knowledge gaps matters more. Must surround with experts in designing, building, marketing, distributing. Embrace their knowledge, don't make decisions beyond expertise, avoid leaning too heavily on familiar. (4) Build mutually respectful relationships - mentor advice: PMs should [almost] always let everyone else take credit while they take blame. Not just to make people feel good - when PM expends energy showing visionary greatness, damages team morale/motivation. Visionary PMs who don't sweep streets get in way of team efforts. Managers dreaming up idyllic vision slow development, silence other voices. Shows process is about catering to PM's whims/ego rather than building right product. Must give teammates respect, show appreciation, make clear success tied to team success. In practice, team actually deserves credit (PM didn't write code, make designs, create marketing). Once team understands PM support, they return trust/support. Visionary PMs influence development cycle in ways detrimental to process. Startups need someone who: appreciates street sweeper role, prioritizes well, embraces what they don't know, invests in relationships. Building great products is about iterating and supporting smooth development process. For leadership hiring PM: ask what candidate thinks their job will be. Do they see themselves sitting in back room thinking of next big thing? Or as facilitator? Answer is telling - right approach engenders sustained success.

### GitLab Product Principles

- **Source:** GitLab Handbook
- **Author:** GitLab (Company-wide product principles)
- **URL:** https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/
- **Date:** 2025)
- **Key Concepts:** Product principles, customer-centric innovation, customer zero, design-led, quality over velocity, data-driven, iteration, MVC (Minimal Valuable Change), convention over configuration, subtractive thinking, integration principles, product-led growth, feature naming, next-generation development, user experience, ambition, product usage, flow one, small primitives, feature ownership
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive set of product principles for building world-class products through customer-centric innovation. Eight core principles: (1) We are customer zero - use our own product, challenge "why" if feature isn't something Engineering would use. (2) We are not our only customer - meet with customers, validate assumptions through user research/interviews/feedback. (3) We are design-led - UX is top priority, technical product should be easy for someone new to get started. (4) We value quality over velocity - everything must be user validated, bug free, secure, scalable, documented, available on all deployments. No technical debt in favor of velocity. (5) We value data over intuition - measure outcomes not launches, all features instrumented for success metrics. (6) We fail fast and iterate with intention - define hypothesis, validate through problem validation, build iteration strategy, revalidate through solution validation. (7) Product-led growth - product should be best Sales team member, enable feature discovery moments. (8) We win as a team - highest execution and collaboration across Product and cross-functional teams. Key frameworks: Minimal Valuable Change (MVC) - smallest measurable improvement with four pillars: relentless customer focus, measurable outcomes, product functionality adhering to GA criteria, future vision. MVC means reducing scope to ship quickly, not shipping something that hurts usability. First impressions important. Examples: ship via API before UI, expose minimal functionality. Not advised for core experiences. Iteration - break problems down small, focus on reduced cycle time. Each iteration must define expected impact and establish metrics for success. Success measured by achieving objectives, not deployment. Subtractive thinking - humans favor adding features, PMs should recognize bias and remove features when more efficient. Convention over Configuration - reduce complexity while offering needed features. Working by default (enabled + setup by default). Avoid limits, avoid configuration when possible. Configuration principles: builds up over time, hard to remove, expensive testing mechanism (use feature flags instead). Avoid "Not Invented Here" - leverage existing technology to get to market quickly, contribute to Open Source, focus on making GitLab better. Integrate thoughtfully - don't clone everything, prevent broken workflows for free, charge for adding value, respect security/permissions, use empty states for discovery, use own design language, be transparent about data source. Avoid plugins/marketplaces - open core allows adding directly to codebase, works out of box, tested together, no upgrade fears. Product naming - descriptive not distinctive names (efficient, inclusive), use prepositions for third-party integrations. Next Generation: Modern first (modern teams before legacy), Developer first (start with developer then other personas), Cloud-native first (then support rest), Prioritize current adopters (optimize for current/future adopters over early adopters). UX principles: Strive for simplicity, Depth over breadth, Better than before (MVC not better than nothing), Timeless design. Be Ambitious - accomplish "impossible" things, velocity unchanged whether scheduled ambitiously or with slack. Drive Product Usage - AARRR framework (single feature), Customer Adoption Journey (cross-adoption). Golden Journey: Create → Plan → Verify → Release. Flow One - workflow of MVCs for specific narrow use-case, avoid inflexible long-term plan. Additional: Avoid enforced workflows (allow enterprise flexibility at group level, default off), Prefer small primitives (building blocks, can be combined), Every feature owned by group (unowned = unsupervised, accrues debt), Always allow deploying to production (safeguards removable in emergency), Data-driven work (tools for both SaaS/self-managed, start from question).

### How to Hire a Product Manager

- **Source:** Bring the Donuts (Ken Norton's Blog)
- **Author:** Ken Norton (Executive Coach, Former Google Product Leader)
- **URL:** https://www.bringthedonuts.com/essays/productmanager.html
- **Date:** 2025, updated 2023
- **Key Concepts:** Product management, hiring product managers, PM skills, product instincts, technical background, leadership, shipping products, startup hiring, product management career
- **Key Insight:** Classic essay that defined the product manager role and launched thousands of PM careers. Reality: Product management may be the one job organization would get along fine without (at least for a while). Without engineers, nothing built; without sales, nothing sold; without designers, product looks like crap. But without PMs, everyone fills in gap and goes on. Important reminder: as PM, you're expendable. In long run great product management makes difference between winning/losing, but you have to prove it. Product management is weird discipline full of oddballs and rejects that never quite fit in anywhere else - combines elements of engineering, design, marketing, sales, business development. Six key characteristics: (1) Hire all the smart people - most importantly, raw intellectual horsepower. Take wickedly smart inexperienced PM over average intellect with years of experience. Product management is about thinking on feet, staying ahead of competitors, projecting into minds of colleagues/customers. Ask analytical questions until sure candidate is smarter than you. Best candidates bounce out of chairs with excitement when posed theoretical problems. Update 2023: Don't ask brainteaser/logic puzzle questions - move toward structured interviews with work samples and situational problems without "right answer." (2) Strong technical background - not necessarily CS degree, but favor people who've been in technical roles. Gives ability to relate to engineers and grasp technical details. Technical PMs more successful conveying requirements to engineers and relaying details to non-technical colleagues/customers. Critical pitfall: PM who's former engineer needs to realize they're FORMER engineer. PMs who still try to take charge of technical decisions/implementation details will crash spectacularly. Prefer technical people who've already made move to product management at previous job - they've gone through adaptation period. Interview questions: Why move from engineering to PM? Biggest advantage/disadvantage of technical background? Biggest lesson learned? What wish you'd known as engineer? How earn respect of engineering team? (3) "Spidey-sense" product instincts and creativity - highly subjective, difficult to evaluate, extraordinarily important. Certain people born with innate product instincts - just know what makes great product, instincts usually point right direction, passionate advocates. Small decisions where great PM distances from decent one. Know they've got spidey-sense when suggest approaches nobody thought of but immediately strike everyone as obvious. Evaluating in interview: check if candidate (a) independently echoed your concerns about product, (b) taught you something new about product (shows not afraid to speak critically, probably smarter), (c) turned you on to something new and interesting (people with great instincts notice great products before everyone else). Interview questions: Tell me about great product you've encountered recently (drives crazy when candidates name your products). What made [iPod/eBay] successful? What do you dislike about my product? How improve it? What problems will we encounter in 1/2/10 years? How know product well designed? Best/worst ideas ever had? How know when to cut corners? Lessons about UI design? How decide what not to build? Biggest product mistake? Least interesting aspects of PM? Consider yourself creative? Update 2023: Product designers ascended to "third leg of stool" - include product designers in interview loop. (4) Leadership that's earned - PMs usually leaders but don't have direct line authority, earn authority and lead by influence. Leadership and interpersonal skills critical. Reference checks most effective way to measure, especially peers/individual contributors who worked with but didn't report to candidate. Interview questions: Is consensus always good? Difference between management and leadership? Kinds of people like/difficult to work with? Time team didn't gel? How get team to commit to schedule? What lose your confidence? Manage people from different functions differently? Learned about saying no? Ultimate accountability for shipping? Team let you down and you took blame? Tolerance for mistakes changed? Good news or bad news first? Approach to hiring? (5) Ability to channel multiple points-of-view - requires wearing multiple hats, advocate for whoever isn't in room (customer, engineering, sales, executives, marketing). Capable of doing other people's jobs but smart enough to know not to. Play devil's advocate, unsatisfied with simple answers. Evaluating: get lots of people in interview process. At minimum, representatives from engineering, design, marketing. Can grow to pre-sales engineering, support, developer relations, business development, legal, customers. One carefully selected representative of each key function. Nobody judges understanding of sales process like salesperson. Give specific instructions to interviewers. Interview questions: How learned to work with sales? Best way to interface with customers? What makes marketing tick? How know when design on right track? How PM support business development? Learned about managing up? Best way to work with executives? (6) Give me someone who's shipped something - unless position very junior, hire PMs who've actually shipped product (start to finish, concept to launch). Nothing better indication of ability to ship great products than having done it before. Past performance indicates future success. Check references with manager and engineering/sales/marketing counterparts. Note: Rules ordered for reason - take brilliantly smart PM over dimmer experienced one even if former hasn't shipped. Startup vs Big Company: Startup needs strong generalists who adapt (everyone does little of everything, hard to predict future). Big company has specific roles (lower likelihood of change). Deadly thinking at startup: "seems suited for this very specific role" - works at big company, deadly at startup.

### How to Work Faster in a Remote Team

- **Source:** Zapier Blog
- **Author:** Danny Schreiber (Content Marketing team at Zapier)
- **URL:** https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-productivity/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Remote work, productivity, distributed teams, communication tools, remote team practices, time management, work environment, asynchronous work, meeting efficiency
- **Key Insight:** Practical guide based on real experiences from remote-first companies. Fundamental difference: Non-remote work defaults to highest distraction communication (in-person), remote work defaults to lowest (no communication). Fewer distractions lead to faster work - you have to purposely decide to enter more distracting conversations. Remote work succeeds in environments with little red tape and low barrier to decision making. Eight ways to work faster: (1) Pull internal communication out of inbox - only two types of internal emails at Zapier (interview feedback, new hire announcements). Move updates/specs/mock-ups to internal blog, feedback/discussions to Slack. Communication feels cheap but adds up to lots of time costs. Streamlining and cutting back-and-forth is true benefit. (2) Rely on right tools - when team lands on right tools, get in groove. Master communication tools (Google Docs, Trello, Slack, Flowdock, video chat). Twilio example: more efficient than in-person because mastery over tools, writing-review-revision feedback loop inherently asynchronous. If one tool doesn't work, move to next. (3) Use differing schedules to advantage - flexible hours for peak productivity (overcome natural lulls with naps/workouts), work when most productive, 24/7 development with time zones (customers get help any hour, production never stops), handoff advantage (end of day in one timezone = start of next day marked up in another). (4) Skip commute - save dozens of hours weekly, zero friction between working and not, apply same principle (prepare lunch, use thermos, cut excess processes). (5) Cancel meetings - video conference annoyance helps you avoid them. Ask: do we really need that meeting? Earn back dozens of hours monthly (one org identified 7,000 hours saved). Example: iDoneThis reconfigured unfocused weekly meetings to show-and-tell sessions. (6) Think before you speak (send) - written communication forces thought, extra steps add filter, clearer/more concise communication. Amazon approach: ban PowerPoint, require memos (full sentences harder to write, force clear thinking). Chat is more to the point, skips chit-chat. (7) Set up best environment - Jason Fried insight: people rarely say "the office" when asked where they get things done. Office shreds day into work moments (15 min here, 30 min there). Remote: control environment (quiet home), change surroundings quickly (stand/sit/couch), work from anywhere (mall/coffee shop/park bench). First telecommuting experience: finishing tasks much earlier, working better in environment. (8) Own up to productivity - responsible for productivity, must own what you did/didn't accomplish. Example: Belle Cooper cut blog post time from 2 days to 4 hours by examining what held her up (cut excess research, distractions). Practical tip: Trello board for to-dos, automation for weekly recaps (cut from 40 to 20 min). Downsides: time zone delays (waiting for responses from people asleep), lone remote member challenges (harder to communicate via whiteboards), infrastructure issues (shoddy internet). Key insight: might not need to go fully remote - instant messaging apps, collaborative editing, file sharing already shift how we communicate. Even companies that don't allow remote work encourage it implicitly through equipment and habits. Personal tip: completely unplug from communication tools, put 100% focus in distraction-free environment.

### Remote Work Emergency Plan: What to Do (and Where to Start)

- **Source:** GitLab Handbook
- **Author:** GitLab (primarily Darren Murph, Head of Remote)
- **URL:** https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture//all-remote/remote-work-emergency-plan/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Remote work, emergency transition, work-from-home, remote leadership, handbook, communications plan, tool stack, change management, forced remote work, crisis management
- **Key Insight:** Practical guide for leaders who suddenly find themselves managing work-from-home teams. Critical distinction: It is neither remote work nor an experiment. Being forced to work from home during a pandemic restricts all but a handful of remote work benefits. The heart of remote work (freedom to choose where you work, ability to weave life into work schedule, opportunity to optimize life for something other than proximity to office) remains squashed. Leaders must untangle "remote work" from "crisis-induced work-from-home" and help workers visualize liberating remote future vs isolating forced work-from-home. Five focus areas: (1) Establish Remote Leadership Team - shift triggers shockwave of change, evaluate managers, rally experts with remote experience who can communicate nuances, document challenges in real time, transparently prioritize, assign DRIs. Executive assistants may take on more significant role as documentarians and aiding internal communications. (2) Establish handbook - start rudimentary, single source of truth, communicate company-wide, update continually with DRIs for common questions. Can start as webpage or repository in Notion, serves well after crisis. Biggest challenge: keeping everyone informed efficiently. Systematically document process changes in central place to minimize confusion. Working remotely requires writing things down - for companies without documentation culture, this is most difficult shift. (3) Establish communications plan - depending on team size, consider always-on video conference room per team where members can linger or come/go. Simulation helps acclimation, shows intentionality around informal communication (spontaneous in office, needs immediate replacement remotely). Transparency vital - leaders shouldn't hold back, maintain perspective, everyone reacts differently, not all homes ideal workspaces, feels jarring, team expects frequent updates. Funnel communication into as few places as possible to reduce silos/fragmentation, proactively solve mass confusion finding things (policies, protocols, messaging). (4) Minimize tool stack - strip down to minimum: Google Docs, company-wide chat (Teams/Slack), Zoom. If VPN needed, ensure easy access with clear instructions. Companies without documentation culture will find this most difficult shift. (5) Drive change - humans naturally resistant to change, especially forced during uncertainty/crisis. Leaders must meet reality head-on. All-hands approach to recognizing new reality advised, vital to empowering everyone to contribute. For companies with strong in-office experience: remote transition is process not binary switch. Leaders responsible for embracing iteration, being open about what works/doesn't, messaging to all employees. Core: managing remote company like any company - trust, communication, company-wide support of shared goals. Additional resources available: pitfalls, phases of adaptation, transitioning company, forcing functions, combating burnout/isolation/anxiety, self-service mindset. GitLab expertise: one of world's largest all-remote companies, 100% remote with no offices, 1,500+ team members in 65+ countries, Head of Remote has 15+ years experience. "How to Manage a Remote Team" course on Coursera - free with optional $49 certificate, covers leading remotely, building remote culture/practices, assessing readiness, creating transformation strategy, final project creates strategic plan for remote transition. Intermediate-level, requires 1+ year management experience, no remote experience required.

### A Guide to Distributed Teams

- **Source:** Increment Magazine (Stripe)
- **Author:** Juan Pablo Buriticá (VP of Engineering at Splice) and Katie Womersley (VP of Engineering at Buffer)
- **URL:** https://increment.com/teams/a-guide-to-distributed-teams/
- **Date:** November 2019 (Issue 11: Teams)
- **Key Concepts:** Distributed teams, remote work, communication, coordination, collaboration, organization, operations, culture, time zones, synchronous vs asynchronous, cross-functional teams, remote hiring, onboarding
- **Key Insight:** Comprehensive guide to building effective distributed teams. Core principle: All teams past certain size become distributed. Effective distributed team is effective team - evaluate same way. What makes distributed different is intention and advanced planning - doesn't happen by accident, requires deliberate systems around communication, coordination, collaboration, organization, operations, culture. Six key areas: (1) Communication - default state is miscommunication. Assume someone missed message, repeat yourself, drop passive-aggressive tone. Neutral tones read negative, positive as neutral - overcorrect with emoji/GIFs/explicit communication. Skip sarcasm/irony. Synchronous vs asynchronous: synchronous for real-time exchange, bonds teams, vital for creative ideation, easier to spot problems. Don't let be ad hoc - get teams on cadence. Asynchronous reduces meetings, allows deep work, makes information distribution clear/reliable, scales better. Default to asynchronous for nonblocking items. (2) Coordination - time impacts everything. Harder to react quickly, mitigate with predictability. Establish tempo everyone can predict. Time zone strategies: hybrid (constrained range, Splice example - US Eastern to Pacific), fully distributed (Buffer - 15 hour spread, try to keep teams to 8 hours or less). "Pass the baton" - hand over work across time zones, avoids silos, keeps morale high. Challenges: affects meals, people left out or asked to accommodate. Need at least 2 hours overlap during regular working time. Hybrid needs active management to prevent co-located teams dominating scheduling. (3) Collaboration - not better than co-located, just different. Physically constrained means strategic changes need higher value threshold - many OSS projects successful with this. Glue work (whatever makes org successful - strategy, meetings, PM, design review, mentoring, coaching) - reward explicitly in promotion processes. Important for reducing gender wage gap (women carry burden in collaborative cultures). Face-to-face still critical - meet every 6 months, more than 2 days overwhelming. Plan like mini-conferences. Budget as recurring line item. As team grows, may yield diminishing returns. Collaboration is art and science - observe what works, adjust. (4) Organization - Brooks's law hits earlier. Keep teams small (3-4 engineers to 1 PM works well, 6-7+ becomes difficult). Cross-functional teams own customer-facing outcome, reduce interdependencies, decisions made close to problem. Resist adding every function - embed by having representatives. Working groups organized by function (informal discussion or formalized with specific task) counteract loss of domain expertise/standardization. In orgs 30+ people, delivery team (SREs, FREs, QREs) can own "delivering software" - clear roadblocks, support getting work out door. Embrace overlap between roles - encourage constructive feedback across teams. (5) Operations - bridge strategy with execution. Equipment: minimum is laptop, headphones, decent internet. Buffer reimburses basics plus fast home internet/coworking, new laptops on join, replace after 3 years. Splice offers home-office improvement stipend (peripherals, plants), ships monitor/laptop preference, office-chair stipend. Hiring remotely: mirror how you'll work (video calls not in-person). Pay attention to clarity of written communication, responsiveness, punctuality, communication about delays. Ask about independent work, initiative, growth mindset, unblocking themselves. Better predictors than "worked remotely before." Technical exercises with clear rubrics, evaluate mindful communication too. Onboarding: detailed 30/60/90 day plans, check in at each mark, give buddies. Without this, new people band together leading to misinformation/culture fragmentation. Distributed decision-making: adopt RFC process (Rust/Ember style) - space for proposals, not seeking consensus. (6) Culture - don't try to fulfill utopian expectations. Experiences will be different - that's okay. Not everyone thrives remotely - extroverts can feel lonely/isolated, anxiety/depression more common, flexibility can mean loss of structure, freedom can feel like abandonment. Traffic light check-ins (red/yellow/green) at start/end of meetings - quick way to see how people doing, helps humans support each other. Reinforce culture constantly or become network of freelancers. Stated values essential - can't rely on office vibe. Hybrid: distributed portion lives company like TV show, leaders should work remotely to build empathy. Global company culture can transcend local norms. Lavish public praise for values-aligned behavior, swift/firm discouraging what's not. Work-life boundaries: remote workers work longer (sometimes full extra day/week). Manager concern isn't if working but if they ever stop. Model healthy boundaries, turn off chat, take vacation offline, don't develop "always-on" norm. Benefits: distribute opportunity globally, cultural diversity enriches, autonomy/flexibility, scale faster/cheaper, pop geographic bubbles. Downsides: less IRL time, tendency to hermit (schedule out-of-home activities), FOMO. Final: be explicit about constraints and trade-offs, decisions are yours to make, org will evolve.

### Scaling Engineering Teams via RFCs: Writing Things Down

- **Source:** The Pragmatic Engineer Blog
- **Author:** Gergely Orosz (Author of The Software Engineer's Guidebook; previously at Uber, Microsoft, Skype, Skyscanner)
- **URL:** https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/scaling-engineering-teams-via-writing-things-down-rfcs/
- **Date:** 2025, last updated September 21, 2022
- **Key Concepts:** RFCs, Request for Comments, scaling engineering teams, documentation, engineering planning, architecture, knowledge sharing, transparency, engineering culture, design docs, ADRs
- **Key Insight:** Simple five-step RFC process that scales engineering teams from tens to thousands of engineers, successfully used at Uber and other large tech companies. Addresses two common planning issues: (1) lack of visibility on others building same thing, (2) tech/architecture debt from different teams building differently. Five steps: (1) Do planning before building - whiteboarding or talking through with team, be clear on how to get things done. (2) Capture plan in short written document - once clear to team, should be quick to write down "how", don't go overboard. (3) Have select people approve before starting - similar to PR reviews, have relevant people (senior engineers, users) validate planned work. (4) Send planning document to all engineers in company and let anyone comment - yes, sounds crazy but works. (5) Have everyone follow steps for every project beyond trivial complexity, iterate on lightweight RFC-like process. Process works and scales well, addresses visibility, reduces tech/architecture debt, spreads knowledge, engages engineers. Power of writing things down: creates accountability, leads to more thorough decisions. Examples: code review in writing increases quality, written agenda makes meetings less wasteful, writing down plans reduces surprises. Efficiency argument flipped: if everyone agrees, writing should be easy (few hours). Reality: usually less straightforward - reveals issues: "This is not what I meant", "What about this edge case?", "If we change this, could break that part" - great to have these discussions before project halfway done. Reviewers and spreading knowledge: writing for others different from organizing thoughts, specify who needs to read/give thumbs-up, require confirmation in writing. Sending to everyone: sounds crazy, creates noise (manageable with email filters), less plans sent than expected even with hundreds/thousands engineers. Cultural impact: type of information pushed shapes culture - pushing plans to everyone and inviting comments sets tone of trust/responsibility. Personal experience: reading planning docs from variety of teams learned more about other teams' work in months than years at large company without visibility. Self-balancing/correction: allowing anyone to chime in keeps consistent engineering bar - teams on one side realize other side doing similar with different approach/quality bar. Example: US team building feature without considering other parts of world, India team points out localization gaps. Transparency enables self-balancing/correction naturally. Tailoring via iteration: process refined as company grew - started as email to every engineer, changed to mailing lists per domain (backend, mobile, web), templates built by engineers, more tooling for thousands of engineers. Template evolution: reviewers had same questions ("What is motivation?", "How will this be tested?", "Will architecture changes be made?"), engineers created templates that keep being updated. Backend template: approvers, abstract, architecture changes, service SLAs, service dependencies, load/performance testing, multi data-center concerns, security, testing/rollout, metrics/monitoring, customer support. Mobile/Web template: approvers, abstract, UI/UX, architecture changes, network interactions, library dependencies, security, testing/rollout, analytics, customer support, accessibility. Key: iterate/customize to team needs - templates include what they care about (reliability, scale, security). At Uber: many smaller services so load/performance testing/SLAs important. When accessibility became focus for mobile, section added. Process scales: called RFC (Request for Comments) - similarities with RFC publication process in tech community. Stuck because started early (when team small), helped scale knowledge/eliminate silos, scaled from tens to low thousands. New challenges at few thousand engineers (good problem). Real-world example: BaseUI open source project shows RFC process - all RFCs published/reviewed publicly, development only starts after RFC approved. Not unique to Uber: Google (design docs), Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon all have similar RFC processes. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) also good format. Scale/thoroughness/who docs pushed to/strictness/standardization differs by company. Key takeaway: if planning still adhoc, having RFC process in place early on helps engineering scale greatly. Just try and iterate - that's how it always starts.

### Scaling Engineering Organizations

- **Source:** Stripe Atlas Guides
- **Author:** Raylene Yung (Led efforts to expand Stripe globally, bringing product and engineering teams to new markets; previously engineering director at Facebook; BS and MS in computer science from Stanford)
- **URL:** https://stripe.com/in/guides/atlas/scaling-eng
- **Date:** Published on Stripe Atlas Guides
- **Key Concepts:** Scaling engineering teams, recruiting, hiring, training, onboarding, engagement, retention, candidate experience, rubrics, bias training, psychological safety, employee feedback, hackathons, rotations
- **Key Insight:** Lessons learned from scaling Stripe's engineering team. Core philosophy: deliberate choice to add engineers at slower rate than user base growth, take iterative approach to recruiting and developing team. Keep teams small, invest more in each person, nimbly change ways of working. Built culture of feedback and iterative thinking - what works for 50 engineers may not work for 10 or 1000. Three main areas: (1) Recruiting and Hiring - Continuously evolve process (run well for 6-9 months, then update). Build consistent recruiting platform - increases efficiency, prevents bias, raises hiring bar. Run regular training sessions for new hiring managers, clear documentation for small details. Interview design from industry studies/best practices - understand how people approach real-world problems, not esoteric whiteboard skills. Bug Squash: side-by-side solve real historical bug in open-source project, candidate's language choice. Team Role Plays for managers: simulate one-on-one conversations. Standardize questions using written rubrics - define how to run interview, evaluate consistently, compare scores. Rubric example: Communication skills with 1-4 scale (poor, needs improvement, good, exceptional). Integrate rubrics into applicant tracking system. Unconscious bias training. Candidate Review process: recurring meeting with experienced reviewers to examine all interview results, give feedback to interviewers, identify improvements. Raylene attended every session for 6 months initially - engineers appreciated knowing someone reading notes, quality/consistency improved. Define clear hiring goals - avoid passive funnel, hire who you need. Stripe evolution: early years hired generalist engineers, later needed specialists (infrastructure, frontend, international mobile, secure credential storage). Frontend example: candidates said "Stripe doesn't need frontend engineers - you're API company." Raylene showed live demos of web/mobile dashboards, candidate immediately engaged, joined. Designed structured candidate experience for frontend. Start small (infrastructure, frontend), retool one at a time. Now hire across many pipelines (Android, ML, security). Each detail affects recruiting process: job descriptions, recruiter staffing, specialized interview questions/rubrics/prep guides. Create great candidate experience - interview defines first impression. Benchmark: 12-20% acceptance rate from onsite to offer. For every hire, 4-7 people go elsewhere - they represent your company. Likely to hire from candidates' networks - great impression generates referrals. Best practices: written guides before interview, engineers choose language/use own laptop, follow-up anonymous surveys, speak with every candidate, calls for those who don't accept, personalized feedback when no offer. Results: without offers rate 4.1/5, with offers 4.5/5. Candidates who don't join often refer others. (2) Training and Onboarding - Early mistake: not investing enough, sink-or-swim experience, teammates thought it was "test" to evaluate again. Today invest significant time/energy. First months critical - tempting to ask engineer to build feature first week, but investing in onboarding makes happier/more productive. Stripe 101: general onboarding for all employees, connects new hires across company. Few weeks: classes, meet cofounders, build Stripe integration, answer support tickets, collaborate across functions. Scale: 30 sessions, 82 instructors, 200+ employees last year. Results: 100% summarize 3+ Stripe products, 94.5% positive first week/effective use of time, 90% understand Stripe stack. New hires graduate with immediate network across functions - helps navigate organization. /dev/start: engineering-specific onboarding. New engineers anxious to spend time with technical teams, dive into code. Solve practical problem in main application codebase. Small pilot: handful engineers, volunteer mentors, projects from backlogs, one-on-one feedback. Expanded to all engineering. Today: group into temporary virtual teams for 3-4 weeks, dedicated mentor, learn development process while shipping concrete tool/product improvement. Mentors gain project leadership/mentorship experience - sit with team, break down tasks, answer technical/product questions, review code, bridge to rest of engineering. Don't forget soft skills/culture - psychological safety (Google Project Aristotle: most important factor). Write guides to culture/group norms - general communication and team-specific. "Communicating at Stripe" class: mailing lists, email/bug tracker best practices, non-obvious patterns like scheduling meetings. Calendar norms carry cultural knowledge. Example: Email at Stripe - non-urgent use email, quick response use Slack, OOO autoresponder, send shipped@ email, don't lurk unnecessarily, safe environment for open communication. Engineering teams provide specialized guides for tools (GitHub, JIRA) or practices (code review) - source of truth, collaborative agreement, reduce debate/confusion. Self-serve documentation decreases reliance on oral tradition, scales faster. (3) Engagement and Retention - Invest in team you have. Employee happiness: know impact of work, feel autonomy in decisions. Successful teams: provide structure for long-term engagement, actively listen to feedback, define clear paths for growth, train leaders. Companies can focus short-term output OR long-term productivity. High-growth: conditions change rapidly, early decisions have lasting impact, early employees carry disproportionate knowledge, most effective, greatest mentors, but can feel overloaded/trapped. Collaborate with early employees to build right supporting structure. Don't mistake productivity for engagement - "surprise resignation" story: long-tenured engineer consistently delivering high-quality work, challenging projects, mentoring, quietly resigned at one-on-one. No longer felt challenged - couldn't see way to increase impact and learn new skills. Stuck in local maximum - easier to leave for exciting opportunity than less-impactful internal role. Realization: simple conversation about career aspirations would have revealed concern. People stay engaged when feel personal sense of growth - look beyond day-to-day productivity, ask right questions. StripeSat survey twice yearly: opportunities to learn/grow, see yourself at Stripe in 3 years, good career opportunities (stretch assignments, responsibility, internal mobility). Create supported paths for mobility/learning - help people discover opportunities, create independent projects, shape story/role. Internal resources: advertise new teams, encourage rotations, run hackathons. Rotations: learn new language, explore different stack, sometimes permanently switch teams. Past 6 months: dozen+ engineers rotated between iOS mobile, core payment API, ML. Highlight roles for internal transfers - bootstrapping new team, complex technical problem. Direct longest-tenured engineers to projects where provide most help. Hackathons: don't need weeks of planning or new team. Recent hackathon: 80 participants across offices, shipped 7 projects to internal/external users (right-to-left language support, internal productivity tools). Ask for feedback and respond - requires scalable approach and careful listening. Employees recognize problems but don't always know how to translate to effective change. Three steps: identify problem, design way to collect structured feedback, address feedback/deliver results. Developer Experience survey example: engineers described dev environment as slow/inefficient. Formed team of experienced engineers focused on internal developer experience. Intuition/expertise not enough to identify most impactful projects. Launched survey: hours lost due to dev process problems, 1-2 things to make more productive, what's harder than it should be. Results: most common request (by factor of 2!) was faster/more reliable edit-sync-test loop. Team tackled projects to improve speed/reliability of syncing/reloading/testing. Next round months later: satisfaction improved 50-80%. Created positive feedback loop, engineers felt heard. Now run Developer Experience surveys every quarter. Key principle: how you scale team has enormous impact on culture, productivity, employee engagement, business success. At quickly growing companies, conditions change rapidly - what works today may not hold tomorrow. Continue iterating, develop new practices as grow.

### Managing Your Time as a Middle Manager

- **Source:** The Heartbeat Newsletter (Canopy)
- **Author:** Claire Lew (Founder & CEO of Canopy)
- **URL:** https://newsletter.canopy.is/p/managing-your-time-as-a-middle-manager
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Middle management, time management, player-coach, leadership, prioritization, fluid focus, context switching, work-life balance, management challenges
- **Key Insight:** How to allocate time when caught in the middle between direct reports and supervisors - the "player-coach" tension. Core problem: Leaders feel squeezed at both ends, overwhelmed, never knowing if priority is right, depleted trying to keep up. The toothpaste tube analogy: squeezed from both ends, no one concerned middle won't fit. Player-coach tension: On one end, expected to map team goals, hold 1:1s (coach role). On other end, asked to deliver tactical work - writing code, designing feature, creating marketing campaign (player role). Not inherently bad - player work keeps you connected to passion, keeps skills sharp. But lived experience feels bad - overwhelmed, depleted. DO NOT: Chase balance or believe perfect distribution exists. Balance is illusion. No magical formula. What's "best" depends on context - what's required of you, team, organization in that moment. DO: Figure out what's most high-leverage for your specific context. Ask: What's most urgent? What is team success most contingent on? What's most critical to team/organization at this moment? Might discover need to step back and nurture team, or double down on personal deliverables first. Examine which role (player or coach) would truly be high leverage. DO: Choose only 1 focus at a time, for specific period of time. Not two, just one. Decide what role you'll concentrate energy on, and for what period. Called "Fluid Focus." Example: Focus on coach role to help team navigate reorg - set aside 1 month. Intentionally place IC engineering work in back seat for that month. Accept trade - acknowledge won't get much (if any) progress on coding during that month. That's okay. Player role is something you'll come back to. To perform exceptionally well in one role rather than subpar in both, must pick one role to focus on at a time. Can switch focus later (Fluid Focus). However, none of this works if don't communicate it. DO NOT: Assume can put head down and just get job done. May seem great idea to focus purely on coach role for 1 month. But if team thinks receiving your code was top priority, they'll be confused why you haven't shipped it. If supervisor had deadline for code in mind, they'll believe you dropped the ball. DO: Communicate exactly the role you're prioritizing and why - with both team and supervisor. While may seem obvious to you, no one will know unless you tell them. Detail: (1) Role you're prioritizing (player or coach), (2) Period of time you'll be prioritizing that role, (3) Why you're prioritizing this role. Example to team: "For next 3 weeks, shifting priorities to focus on creation of new marketing campaign. As result, we'll pause our 1:1 meetings and team check-ins. May feel like I'm more absent than usual, but merely short phase to serve company's overall goals. Company's growth targets require I knock this out now, need focus deep work time. You can expect me to come out of this phase in 3 weeks, pick back up our 1:1 meetings again." Example to supervisors: "For next 3 weeks, thinking it makes sense to shift priorities to focus on completing creation of new marketing campaign - that way can hit deadline you intended for Q2 growth goals. Are you okay with me prioritizing this? If so, some managerial updates I usually send will be on pause for those 3 weeks, but happy to resume after phase completed. How does that sound?" For communication to supervisors in particular, actively asking for input on prioritization - ensures aligned with expectations, not superseding what supervisor believes most critical. DO NOT: Underestimate cost of context switching. Little wonder we're so tired as leaders. Context-switching consumes energy. Studies found 40% of productivity lost when context-switching. Accept that switching of context itself is work. Build in margin for that energy expenditure. Perhaps place 1 week buffer between modes as "catch up" time, where don't have specific focus on player or coach role. Gives time to evaluate which role might be best to focus on in next phase. Or maybe carve out break and take time off. DO NOT: Stay in 1 lane for too long... because you like it. Be wary of personal preferences for allocating time as leader. We all have bias to mode that's more "fun." For some, that's relishing being coach - helping team solve problems, coaching careers. For others, most comfortable jamming in deep work of player role. What we personally like is not always what situation requires. Must be truthful with ourselves to not conflate the two. The 4 Steps of Fluid Focus: (1) Stop chasing "balance." Commit to making trade. (2) Choose 1 role to focus on (player or coach) and period of time. (3) Communicate this choice to team and supervisor. (4) Readjust and reassess as needed. Inconvenient truth: Choice isn't obvious. Excruciatingly, almost impossibly hard to decide on just one role. Part of you wishes could "cheat" and do both roles at once. But remind yourself of toothpaste tube: Reason so exhausted and displeased is because squeezing yourself from both sides. Trying to do too many things at once. Embrace trade-off. Relish freedom to be fluid in focus. Side effects: Cognitive load of doing two roles at once slowly relieved. Find depth in work, not just surface area covered. Actual output of work more satisfactory. Reference to Andy Grove's "High Output Management": "My day always ends when I'm tired and ready to go home, not when I'm done. I'm never done." Managers have endless task list - leads to multi-tasking path. Worst part is feeling: mediocre at everything, great at nothing. Power of mono-tasking: choosing just one thing to do, and doing it well.

### Does Your Organization Have a Security.txt File?

- **Source:** Krebs on Security
- **Author:** Brian Krebs (Cybersecurity journalist and investigative reporter)
- **URL:** https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/does-your-organization-have-a-security-txt-file/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Security.txt, vulnerability disclosure, security operations, internet standards, IETF, bug bounty programs, security contact information, operational security, cybersecurity
- **Key Insight:** Proposed Internet standard (not yet official IETF) that helps organizations describe vulnerability disclosure practices and preferences. Problem: Organizations get hacked because no obvious way for security researchers to report vulnerabilities or data leaks. Idea: Place file called security.txt in predictable place (example.com/security.txt or example.com/.well-known/security.txt). Contents vary but typically include: links to vulnerability disclosure policies, contact email address, links to bug bounty programs, public encryption keys, links thanking researchers, links to IT security job openings. Examples: USAA includes bug bounty program links, email, encryption key, disclosure policy, researcher thank you page. HCA Healthcare: contact email, responsible disclosure policies link, security job openings link. Why it matters: Makes easier to respond to active security threats. Real-world example: Major clothing retailer had VPN credentials stolen, no security.txt file, security@ email blocked, message to CIO - no way to know if read. Alex Holden (Hold Security): Malicious hackers often struggle getting attention of proper people in organizations they hacked. "In cases of ransom, bad guys try to contact company with demands. You have no idea how often their messages get caught in filters, get deleted, blocked or ignored." Many organizations unofficially use security@[companydomain] but not standardized or well-publicized, can be blocked. Adoption: Not yet official IETF standard, but 8% of Fortune 100 adopted (Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, HCA Healthcare, Kroger, Procter & Gamble, USAA, Walmart). Major downside: Setting up security.txt invites high volume of spam. Self-appointed penetration testers run automated vulnerability discovery tools, submit reports hoping for consulting engagement or bug bounty fee. Hacker News threads discuss being flooded with low-quality vulnerability scan reports, difficult to spot reports worth pursuing. Edwin "EdOverflow" Foudil (co-author of proposed standard) acknowledges: "Organizations that implement this are going to get flooded. One reason bug bounty programs succeed is they are basically glorified spam filter. But regardless of approach, going to get inundated with crappy, sub-par reports." Often from individuals who scanned entire Internet for one or two vulnerabilities, contacted all vulnerable organizations at once semi-automated. Managing noise: Many nuisance reports can be ignored or grouped by creating filters looking for keywords commonly found in automated vulnerability scans. Success stories: Tremendous feedback from universities that implemented security.txt. "Incredible success with universities, which tend to have lots of older, legacy systems. In that context, seen ton of valuable reports." Origin: Came about after chatting with people at DEFCON (annual security conference in Las Vegas) struggling to report security issues to vendors. Foudil not trying to make money off it. Main reason not promoting heavily: not yet official standard. Key takeaways: (1) Standardized way for organizations to publish vulnerability disclosure practices/contact info, (2) Solves real problem - lack of clear, predictable way for researchers to report vulnerabilities, (3) Trade-offs - easier for legitimate researchers but generates high volume of low-quality reports, (4) Spam can be managed with email filters/keyword filtering, (5) Particularly valuable for organizations with legacy systems (universities), (6) Not yet official but adopted by major Fortune 100 companies, suggesting practical value before formal IETF approval.

### SOC2: The Screenshots Will Continue Until Security Improves

- **Source:** Fly.io Blog
- **Author:** Thomas Ptacek (@tqbf)
- **URL:** https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** SOC2, compliance, security audit, DRL, Type I, Type II, SSO, access control, vulnerability management, security policies, operational security, security certification
- **Key Insight:** Practical guide to SOC2 compliance from someone who project-managed Fly.io's SOC2 certification. Bottom line for customers: SOC2 is weak positive indicator of security maturity, similar ballpark to penetration test report (but less than multiple pentests). Key distinctions: (1) SOC2 is accounting-style audit confirming on-paper claims about security processes, not like adversarial security audits/penetration tests. (2) About security of company (can customer support pop shell on prod?), not products (can attacker pop shell with SQL injection?). (3) Guts are giant spreadsheet questionnaire (DRL) and battery of screenshots as evidence. (4) DRL is high-level/abstract, product of accounting standards like COSO framework, understands "git" and "MFA" but nothing lower-level. (5) Two types: Type I (point-in-time snapshot), Type II (confirms consistent adherence over months). Can't flunk Type I but Type II more annoying - can't travel back in time to close gaps. What SOC2 assures that pentests don't: consistent access policies, everyone has 2FA, capability to fire alerts on weird logs, severed employees reliably have access terminated, company not run by 4 raccoons in trenchcoat (or policy written accepting risk). For customers: Intensely technical/high-risk engineering? Look for pentest. Huge number of employees? Get SOC2. What's SOC2: Best-known infosec certification, only one routinely demanded by customers. Structure: AICPA "Trust Services Criteria" and COSO framework. Categories: security (mandatory, only one matters for most), availability, transaction integrity, confidentiality, privacy. DRL = Document Request List - giant spreadsheet auditor customizes to your company after scoping call. Can't reason back to first principles - just take their word for it. When to SOC2: Wait as long as you can. Important distinction: "Getting SOC2-certified" ≠ "doing engineering work to get SOC2-certified". Do engineering now, as early as possible - work scales with team size. Audit itself doesn't matter except to answer customer request "can I have your SOC2 report?" Do it when more economical to get certification than hand-hold prospects through security process. Why customers ask: It's viral like GPL. DRL suggests policy to "collect SOC2 reports from all vendors". Customers ask because they're SOC2 and AICPA wants them to force you to join coven. Don't have to do it - can speak confidently about security practice or pay audit firm to make problem go away. Makes little sense to get certified before customers demand it. Can make purchase order contingent on Type I in next year. What SOC2 made Fly.io do: (1) Single Sign-On - every CSO says SSO was first 3 things. Obvious why: single place to control credentials (phishing-proof MFA), access to apps, offboarding. Moved everything to Google SSO. Inside network: certificate-based SSH access control (Teleport). To reach Teleport need VPN, to get VPN need Google SSO. Teleport authenticated separately via Github SSO. Two auth sources of truth for SSH. Teleport killer feature: transcript-level audit logs for every SSH session, can watch other team sessions, go back in time. "SSO tax" - pain to pay for SAAS accounts supporting SAML/OIDC. Early days can skip for non-sensitive vendors, but mostly just pay. (2) Protected Branches - surprisingly important to auditors. Concern: developer might "go rogue" and install malware. Easy to enable in Github but also need documented approval process ensuring changes reviewed. Fly.io wasn't doing this - have teams-of-one components. Solution: Post-facto reviews. Regular reviews on large components, smaller projects/urgent fixes can merge unreviewed (by authorized subset), Github bot flags PRs, weekly meeting to review. (3) Centralized Logging - big chunk of DRL about monitoring. Auditors nudge toward centralizing (but you want this anyway - every logging system is one to document/screenshot/write policy about). Fly.io got off easy - logging is platform feature, large ElasticSearch/VictoriaMetrics clusters, single query away from any event. SOC2 forced picking ticketing system (had avoided for years). Alerts to Slack/PagerDuty, documented ticketing processes. HelpScout surprise: got lots of SOC2 mileage - support/security@ mails go there, good system of record for events SOC2 cares about (internal/external security reports). (4) CloudTrail - barely use AWS but audit firms added AWS-specific line-items. Better at indexing/alerting CloudTrail now, not very useful to their security practice. (5) Infrastructure-as-Code - auditors know Terraform/CloudFormation, want you using it. Job is documenting how your deployment system is similar to Terraform. Host inventory annoyance: trivial for AWS (API/CLI), Fly.io runs own hardware, systems of record are idiosyncratic, ended up taking screenshots of SQL queries. (6) MDM/Endpoint Management - surprise: endpoint security has fallen out of fashion in 2022. Didn't have to document endpoint strategy. Can cross off checklist. (7) Boring Company Stuff - (a) Formal org chart posted where employees can find it. Annoying but whatever. (b) Evidence of annual performance reviews. Fly.io doesn't do annual (continuous feedback, 1-on-1 culture). AICPA can't assure terminated employee if no annual reviews. So now have pro-forma annual reviews. Need to carefully explain to team so don't think stack ranking. (c) Background checks - performative/intrusive, occasionally illegal (European employees), horror stories about flagging for missing transcripts. Only issue had to seriously back-and-forth with auditors. Held line on refusing, got out of it by finding what another company did, stealing process, telling auditors "do what you did for them". (8) Policies - going to write bunch. Most companies phone it in, Google template, adopt first result. Fly.io wrote their own. Simplified by Ryan McGeehan's "Starting Up Security" site (free). Information Security Policy based on Ryan's, all their own words (quotes grugq). Writing policies inspired by Ryan liberates you to write clearly, no "whereas" or "designee". Wrote: Information Security Policy (everyone signs), Data Classification Policy (what can go in Slack/Email vs talk to management), Document Retention policy (from lawyers), Change Management, Risk Assessment (says will build spreadsheet explaining zombie apocalypse handling), Vulnerability Management (roughly explains nmap), Access Request (which Slack channel), Vendor Management (propagates SOC2 virus to vendors), Incident Response (cribbed from Ryan), Business Continuity (Jerome in charge if Kurt arrested for robbing bank), employee handbook. Slab verification feature: highest ROI feature - click button, adds green banner saying "verified" for next several months. Several DRL items about recertifying policies annually - this gave screenshots needed. What Fly.io didn't let SOC2 make them do: (1) Install endpoint software, (2) Run vulnerability scanner (automated nmap for compliance), (3) Collect SOC2 reports from all vendors (will do soon-ish), (4) Clear Prototype Injection alerts from Dependabot for Javascript projects, (5) Install agent software on servers (terrified of agents), (6) Run antivirus on servers (explained why doesn't make sense - documented deployment/CI/CD), (7) Run any other security product (IDS, WAF, SEM, DAST, ASM, XDR, CASB, anything with "mesh"). The Audit Itself: People joke about screenshots - they're not joking. Whole SOC2 audit is essentially series of screenshots. Jarring if you've had security audits by consulting firms (technical experts jump into codebase, try to find flaws). Nothing like that in SOC2 - it's actual audit. DRL line items ask for evidence supporting claims (e.g. "production repos on Github have protected branches"). Evidence almost always screenshots of management interface with feature enabled. Divided evidence collection into series of calls over week, each ~20 minutes, mostly sharing screen saying "that checkbox over there, screenshot that". Prepared for tricky calls, but was chill process. Most important thing: Keep goals modest. Claims you make in Type I bind on Type II; claims you don't make in Type I won't. One Type I goal should be helping future self clear Type II. About report quality: Concerned quality would matter to customers. Got good auditors, wasn't paint-by-numbers. But talking to security people at other companies, takeaway: having SOC2 report is what matters, not what it says. The five Type I reports trick: Peer at highly clueful security-sensitive firm described vendor giving them five consecutive Type I reports. Can skip all real work! (Spent weeks convincing CEO not to do this.) What SOC2 misses: Fly.io does lots of security work SOC2 doesn't care about - misses most of their security model. Build in memory-safe languages, minimize trust between components, simple access control models, get code pentested. SOC2 doesn't communicate this - and that's fine. Can write own security report explaining what they do. For all cynicism, SOC2 dragged them into process improvements they're glad to have. Helped to have clueful auditors, clear eye about what trying to accomplish. Expected "entire new cloud provider" to be complicated case but went smoothly. If easy for them, probably easier for you. Just don't do it until you have to.

### 20 Key Habits that Hold You Back

- **Date:** 2025
- **Original Source:** "What Got You Here Won't Get You There" by Marshall Goldsmith with Mark Reiter, pp. 40-41, Hyperion Books
- **Key Concepts:** Leadership habits, personal development, executive coaching, leadership behaviors, career advancement, self-awareness, leadership effectiveness
- **Key Insight:** 20 common habits that successful people have that worked well to get them where they are, but now hold them back from reaching the next level. Core insight: "What got you here won't get you there" - success at one level often requires different behaviors than success at the next level. These habits often feel like strengths or are so ingrained we don't notice them, but they can undermine team morale, make others feel undervalued, create cultures where people are afraid to speak up, prevent seeing better ideas/solutions, limit ability to grow/adapt. The 20 habits: (1) Winning too much - need to win at all costs in all situations, even when it doesn't matter. (2) Adding value - overwhelming desire to add two cents to every discussion, even when input not needed. (3) Passing judgment - need to rate others and impose standards on them. (4) Making destructive comments - needless sarcasms and cutting remarks we think make us sound sharp/witty, often undermine others. (5) Starting with "No," "But," or "However" - overuse of negative qualifiers that say "I'm right, you're wrong," automatically negate what others said. (6) Telling the world how smart you are - need to show people we're smarter than they think, constantly demonstrating intelligence rather than letting actions speak. (7) Speaking when angry - using emotional volatility as management tool, expressing anger to make point rather than managing emotions constructively. (8) Negativity, or "Let me explain why that won't work" - need to share negative thoughts even when not asked, automatically pointing out problems rather than solutions. (9) Withholding information - refusal to share information to maintain advantage over others, keeping knowledge to maintain power/control. (10) Failing to give proper recognition - inability to praise and reward, not acknowledging others' contributions. (11) Claiming credit that we don't deserve - most annoying way to overestimate contribution to success, taking credit for work/ideas that weren't yours. (12) Making excuses - need to reposition annoying behavior as permanent fixture so people excuse us, rationalizing why we can't/shouldn't have to change. (13) Clinging to the past - need to deflect blame onto events/people from past, subset of blaming everyone else, living in past rather than present/future. (14) Playing favorites - failing to see treating someone unfairly, showing preference for certain people without recognizing inequity. (15) Refusing to express regret - inability to take responsibility, admit wrong, recognize how actions affect others, unwilling/unable to apologize. (16) Not listening - most passive-aggressive form of disrespect, being present but not hearing, making others feel unheard. (17) Failing to express gratitude - most basic form of bad manners, not saying thank you or showing appreciation. (18) Punishing the messenger - misguided need to attack innocent who are trying to help, shooting messenger when receive bad news rather than addressing problem. (19) Passing the buck - need to blame everyone but ourselves, never taking responsibility, always finding someone else to hold accountable. (20) An excessive need to be "me" - exalting faults as virtues because "that's who we are," refusing to change problematic behaviors rather than recognizing growth requires change. Why these habits matter: They worked in earlier stages of career - being competitive, adding value, showing intelligence, being critical helped stand out. But as move into leadership, these behaviors can undermine team morale/collaboration, make others feel undervalued/dismissed, create cultures where people afraid to speak up, prevent seeing better ideas/solutions, limit ability to grow/adapt. Self-assessment: Look at list and honestly assess which habits you recognize in yourself. Most successful people find several. Goal isn't to identify every single one but recognize patterns holding you back. Challenge: Habits often feel like strengths or so ingrained we don't notice. They become part of identity. But recognizing them is first step toward change.

### Porter's Generic Strategies

- **Source:** Wikipedia
- **Author:** Various contributors (based on Michael Porter's work)
- **URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_generic_strategies
- **Date:** 2025 (page continuously updated)
- **Original Sources:**
  - "Competitive Strategy" by Michael Porter (1980), Free Press
  - "Competitive Advantage" by Michael Porter (1985), Free Press
- **Key Concepts:** Competitive strategy, competitive advantage, cost leadership, differentiation, focus strategy, market scope, strategic management, Porter's framework
- **Key Insight:** Framework describing how companies can pursue competitive advantage across chosen market scope. Three generic strategies: cost leadership, product differentiation, and focus (with two variants - cost focus and differentiation focus - making four distinct approaches). Core insight: Company chooses one of two types of competitive advantage - lower costs than competition OR differentiation along dimensions valued by customers to command higher price. Company also chooses one of two types of scope - focus (selected segments) OR industry-wide (many segments). Generic strategy reflects choices regarding both type of competitive advantage and scope. Porter's original argument: Must choose only one strategy or risk "stuck in the middle" scenario. Practicing more than one strategy loses focus, clear direction can't be established. Differentiation incurs costs contradicting low cost strategy. Standardized products won't carry differentiation. Cost leadership and differentiation mutually exclusive - two focal objectives clash. Empirical basis: "Hole in the middle" problem - firms with high market share (cost leaders) and low market share (niche players) profitable, firms with moderate market share (stuck in middle) least profitable. Exception: Combining market segmentation with product differentiation effective. Combinations like cost leadership with differentiation hard (but not impossible) due to conflict between cost minimization and value-added differentiation costs. Cost Leadership Strategy: Target customers in most/all segments based on lowest price. Win market share by appealing to cost-conscious/price-sensitive customers. Lowest prices or lowest price-to-value ratio. Must operate at lower cost than rivals. Three ways: (1) High asset utilization - service industries turn tables/flights fast, manufacturing high volume output. Fixed costs spread over more units = lower unit cost. Economies of scale/experience curve effects. High output requires/creates high market share, entry barrier. (2) Low direct/indirect operating costs - high volumes standardized products, basic no-frills, limit customization/personalization. Production costs low via fewer components, standard components, limit models. Overheads low via low wages, low rent areas, cost-conscious culture. Continuous cost reduction search - outsourcing, controlling production, increasing utilization, minimizing distribution/R&D/advertising. Extensive distribution. Promotional strategy makes virtue of low cost features. (3) Control over value chain - all functional groups (finance, supply/procurement, marketing, inventory, IT) ensure low costs. Supply chain: bulk buying/quantity discounts, squeeze suppliers, competitive bidding, low inventories (JIT, VMI). Example: Wal-Mart squeezing suppliers. Preferential raw materials access, backward integration. Viable for large firms with economies of scale/large volumes/big market share. Small businesses can be "cost focused" not "cost leaders" if have low cost advantages. Example: Local restaurant low rent location, limited menu, rapid turnover, minimum wage staff. Innovation may enable startup/small company offer cheaper product where incumbents too expensive. Example: Low-cost budget airlines - fewer planes but market share growth via cheap no-frills services. Started with cost focused, grew to cost leadership. Disadvantages: Lower customer loyalty (price-sensitive switch when substitute available), reputation for low quality (hard to rebrand/shift to differentiation). Differentiation Strategy: Target customers in most/all segments based on attributes other than price (quality/service) to command higher price. Differentiate favorably relative to competition. Minimize costs in areas that don't differentiate, remain cost competitive. Appropriate when: target segment not price-sensitive, competitive/saturated market, customers have specific under-served needs, firm has unique resources/capabilities difficult to copy. Unique resources: patents/IP, unique technical expertise (Apple design, Pixar animation), talented personnel (sports stars, star traders), innovative processes. Success when: premium price, increased revenue per unit, brand loyalty. Works when added price outweighs added expense, ineffective when uniqueness easily replicated. Brand management creates perceived uniqueness even when physical product same (Chiquita bananas, Starbucks coffee, Nike sneakers, fashion brands). Examples: Hero, Asian Paints, HUL, Nike, BMW, Perstorp BioProducts, Apple, Mercedes-Benz. Not suitable for small companies. Appropriate for big companies applying in one/several functional groups. Example: GE uses finance division to differentiate. May do in isolation or conjunction with focus strategies (requires more investment). Good advantage using differentiation with focus cost/differentiation strategies. Example: Coca-Cola and Royal Crown. Variants: Shareholder value model - timing of specialized knowledge creates differentiation advantage while unique. Customers buy for access to unique knowledge. Advantage static (one-time purchase). Unlimited resources model - greater resources manage risk/sustain profits more easily. Short-term advantage only. Without continual innovation capacity, won't sustain competitive position. Note: Henry Mintzberg argues cost leadership is form of differentiation using lower price. Focus Strategies: Focusing on one or few segments. May offer lower cost (cost focus) OR differentiate (differentiation focus) in that scope. Not separate strategy for big companies due to small market conditions. Big companies applying differentiation may also use focus strategies. Definitely appropriate for small companies, especially wanting to avoid competition with big ones. Narrow focus on few target markets (segmentation/niche strategy). Distinct groups with specialized needs. Choice of low prices or differentiated products/services depends on segment needs and firm resources/capabilities. Focus marketing on one-two narrow segments, tailor marketing mix. Gain competitive advantage through product innovation/brand marketing rather than efficiency. Target segments less vulnerable to substitutes or where competition weakest for above-average ROI. Example: Southwest Airlines - short-haul point-to-point vs hub-and-spoke of United/American. Subsequent Developments: Treacy and Wiersema (1993) modified Porter's three strategies in "The Discipline of Market Leaders" to three "value disciplines": operational excellence, product leadership, customer intimacy. Criticisms/Hybrid Strategy Debate: Several commentators questioned generic strategies - lack specificity, flexibility, limiting, empirical challenges. Miller questions "caught in the middle" - viable middle ground exists. Many companies enter as niche player and expand. Baden-Fuller and Stopford: most successful companies resolve "dilemma of opposites." Reeves and Routledge (2013): entrepreneurial spirit key factor in success, differentiation/cost leadership least important. Contemporary research shows evidence of successful "hybrid strategy." Davis (1984): firms employing hybrid (low cost + differentiation) outperform ones adopting one generic strategy. Hill (1988): challenged mutual exclusivity, argued successful combination results in sustainable competitive advantage. Wright (1990): multiple strategies required to respond effectively to environment. Mid-late 1980s environments stable - no flexibility requirement. Present market contexts rapidly changing/highly unpredictable - require flexibility for contingencies. After 11 years Porter revised thinking and accepted hybrid business strategy could exist. Why hybrid necessary: Highly volatile/turbulent markets don't permit rigid strategies. Long-term establishment depends on agility/quick responsiveness. Market/environmental turbulence makes drastic implications on firm establishment. If strategy can't cope with contingencies, long-term survival unrealistic. Pragmatic approach: Diverging strategy into different avenues to exploit opportunities/avoid threats. Consistent superior performance possible with hybrid strategy - stronger foundations. Depending on market/competitive conditions, hybrid should be adjusted regarding extent each generic strategy (cost leadership or differentiation) given priority. Key Takeaways: Three fundamental strategic options - cost leadership, differentiation, focus. Choice matters - Porter originally argued must choose one or risk "stuck in middle." Context matters - appropriateness depends on firm size, market conditions, resources. Debate continues - framework influential but empirical evidence/practical experience suggest hybrid strategies successful, especially volatile markets. Flexibility key - rapidly changing markets may require combining strategies or adjusting emphasis. Small vs large - focus appropriate for small companies, cost leadership requires scale.

### Can Do Vs Must Do

- **Source:** AVC Blog
- **Author:** Fred Wilson (Co-founder and partner at Union Square Ventures)
- **URL:** https://avc.com/2017/05/can-do-vs-must-do/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Prioritization, focus, strategy, execution, resource management, leadership, rule of three, must-do vs can-do, startup management, saying no
- **Key Insight:** The difference between "can do" and "must do" projects, and how companies often confuse the two. With abundance of capital, portfolio companies have resources to do more than they can and should do. They greenlight "can do" projects but not "must do" projects. Problems when confusing the two: (1) Core resources (infrastructure, security, payments, design, product management) get stretched supporting many efforts, (2) Team loses sight of mission and strategy as so many projects tackled simultaneously, (3) Senior leadership gets pulled in many directions and loses alignment, (4) Projects slip or don't ship, leading to malaise and morale issues, (5) Headcount grows quickly to support efforts, creating management issues. Result: Getting stuck in middle, being mediocre, not doing anything well. Customers see it, staff feel it. The Rule of Three: Should not tackle more than three big things at one time, regardless of organization size. Plans shouldn't have more than three things. Test all initiatives against "must do" vs "can do" test. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Strategy is about saying no: Strategy isn't saying no. It's figuring out what is most important for company and deciding to focus on it and say no to everything else. To figure out what's most important, need to understand: products, customers, market position, where things are going, where you want to be in 3-5 years. Once figured out, determine most important things needed to get there. The startup as video game metaphor: Partner Albert thinks doing startup is like playing video game. Each level requires mastering one thing, then level up and new thing to master. Clarifying view on how to think and prioritize. Focus changes as you level up. Diagnosing problem: If frustrated by pace of development, think about how many things trying to do simultaneously. If a lot, run by "can do" vs "must do" test and kill things that aren't "must dos." Might mean parting ways with people you don't need - painful but helpful. What good execution looks like: Executing well on all "must do" things is hallmark of well-run company. Usually means there aren't many "can do" things on roadmap. Can only do few things well, must be most critical. Time is finite, can't keep adding priorities. Each addition requires removing or deprioritizing something else. The people challenge: People who support "can do" instead of "must do" are frequently closest to you. They're encouraging, see possibilities, want to be helpful. But those are people you need to disappoint most acutely. Frameworks for deciding: Alternative lens is resources and reusability. Three questions: (1) How much do we risk if we don't do it? (2) If we do it, will it enrich platform for everyone? (3) What will it take to deliver? The life application: Applies to business or life. To be successful, say no a lot. To be really successful, say no almost all the time. Don't spread yourself too thin. Time is finite. Activity vs Momentum: Two types of organizations - "Activity" organizations (going nowhere) and "Momentum" organizations (know what they must do and do it well). Keeping main thing the main thing: "The main thing is keeping the main thing the main thing" - Stephen Covey. Regular review: What's main thing? Is everything supporting it? Most companies misunderstand differences between strategy, tactics, objectives. Key takeaways: (1) "Can do" is not same as "must do" - just because have resources doesn't mean should, (2) Rule of three - don't tackle more than three big things at once, (3) Strategy is focus - figuring out what's most important and saying no to everything else, (4) Startup is video game - each level requires mastering one thing, (5) Good execution requires focus - executing well on "must dos" is hallmark of well-run company, (6) Time is finite - can only do few things well, (7) Say no to say yes - path to excellence requires saying no to many "can dos" to say yes to "must dos", (8) Cost of confusion - mixing leads to stretched resources, lost alignment, slipped projects, malaise.

### Good Engineering Strategy Is Boring

- **Source:** Irrational Exuberance (lethain.com)
- **Author:** Will Larson (Author of "An Elegant Puzzle," "Staff Engineer," "The Engineering Executive's Primer," and "Crafting Engineering Strategy")
- **URL:** https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering strategy, engineering vision, design documents, RFCs, tech specs, bottoms-up organizational learning, strategy synthesis, tradeoffs, decision-making
- **Key Insight:** Practical, bottoms-up approach to writing engineering strategy and vision. Core insight: Good engineering strategy is boring, and it's easier to write an effective strategy than a bad one. The process: (1) Write five design documents describing decisions and tradeoffs in specific projects. Design docs have what bad strategies lack - detailed specifics grounded in reality. It's easy for two engineers to interpret abstract strategy differently, but harder to stay misaligned when implementing specific solution. When to write design docs: projects used by numerous future projects, projects meaningfully impacting users, work taking more than month of engineering time. Best practices: Start from problem (clearer problem = more obvious solutions), keep template simple (minimal templates, select useful sections, exhaustive details only for riskiest), gather and review together/write alone (collect input widely but one author writes clearer document than group edits), prefer good over perfect (better to get good document in front of others than delay). To improve: reread designs after implementation, study where implementation deviated from plan. (2) Synthesize five design docs into strategy - read all five together, look for controversial decisions that came up in multiple designs, particularly those hard to agree on. Example: debating whether Redis appropriate as durable storage or only cache - write down recent decisions and rationale as strategy. Good strategies guide tradeoffs and explain rationale. Bad strategies state policy without explanation, decoupling from context. Strategy definition = "diagnosis" and "guiding policies" (deferring "coherent action" to design documents). Best practices: Start where you are (dive in, waiting for missing information doesn't work, whatever you write will need to change), write specifics (write until you generalize then stop, specific statements create alignment, generic create illusion), be opinionated (provide clarity on decision making), show your work (explain rationale so others can modify/extend as context shifts). Some best strategies feel too obvious to write - "When should we write design documents?", "Which databases for which use cases?", "Which services page during off-hours" are all worth writing. (3) Extrapolate five strategies into vision - as collect more strategies, becomes challenging to reason about how strategies interact. Take five recent strategies, extrapolate how tradeoffs will play out over next 2-3 years. Edit through contradictions, weave threads together = engineering vision. Gives "robust belief in the future" (Tanya Reilly) making it easier to understand how existing strategies relate, simplifies writing new strategies. Best practices: Write 2-3 years out (companies/tech change quickly, too far is fraught, too short doesn't work), ground in business and users (tight connection keeps vision aligned with leadership values, bad visions treat technical sophistication as self-justifying), be optimistic not audacious (ambitious but possible, best possible version of possible, write what could accomplish if projects finished on time, don't write infinite resources version), stay concrete and specific (more useful as more specific, generic easy to agree with but don't help reconcile conflicts), keep 1-2 pages long (most people don't read long documents, compact with links to extra context). Managing expectations: Response to vision usually muted - core audience is folks writing strategies (small cohort), great vision is so obvious it bores more than excites. Don't measure by initial excitement. Measure by reading design document from two years ago vs last week - if marked improvement, vision is good. When and why: Strategies are tools of proactive alignment, empower teams to move quickly with confidence, allow everyone to make quick confident decisions (would otherwise cost week of discussion). Write strategy when you've rehashed same discussion 3-4 times. Write vision when future's too hazy to identify investments worth making. If neither sound familiar, move on to other work. The prework: If can't resist urge to include brilliant ideas, write all best ideas into giant document, delete it, never mention again. Clears head for work ahead - process should be grounded in what you've actually done, not what you wish you'd done. Key principle: Durably useful engineering strategy and vision are output of iterative, bottoms-up organizational learning. All learning contributes to strategy and vision, but contribution doesn't have to be abstract. Even if not directly responsible, can take practical steps to advance organization's strategy and vision starting right now.

### Is Engineering Strategy Useful?

- **Date:** 2025
- **Original Source:** This is a chapter from "Crafting Engineering Strategy"
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering strategy, written strategy, implicit strategy, organizational learning, strategy impact, strategy costs, personal development, strategy value
- **Key Insight:** Why engineering strategy matters and why written strategy is valuable. Core insight: There's always an engineering strategy, even if nothing written down. Strategy embedded into organization's decisions, although in many organizations only visible to small group and may be quickly forgotten. If thinking strategy doesn't exist, ask where strategy lives if can't find it. May find it ineffective, but never found that it doesn't exist. Strategy is impactful: Creating alignment (example: Calm's engineering strategy reduced friction by eliminating cause of ongoing debate, reset team focus, caused some engineers to leave because incompatible with priorities - not downside, clear documented strategy let everyone accurately decide if wanted to be part of game). Ways strategies support organizations: (1) Concentrating company investment into smaller space (e.g., deciding not to decompose monolith allows investing majority of tooling on one language, one test suite, one deployment mechanism), (2) Many interesting properties only available through universal adoption (e.g., "N-1 policy" on backfilled roles significant opportunity for managing costs but only works if consistently adopted, disaster recovery/multi-region strategies only viable if all infrastructure has common configuration mechanism), (3) Focus execution on what truly matters (e.g., Stripe's Sorbet strategy allowed team of ten engineers to incrementally move Ruby monolith towards static typing without distracting larger organization, could have consumed entire organization for many months but focus allowed small team accomplish majority of early work), (4) Creating knowledge repository of how organization thinks (onboarding new hires, particularly senior, much more effective with documented strategy, e.g., strategy for accessing user data requires clear user-understandable rationale for access - obvious to new hires from larger companies but folks with only small company experience likely completely unaware necessary, if not documented compliance quickly declines). However developing strategy creates progress even if progress is understanding inherent disagreement. Inappropriate strategy especially impactful: While good strategy accomplishes many things, inappropriate strategy feels far more impactful (in wrong ways). Example: Digg V4 - complete rewrite from PHP monolith to PHP frontend and backend of dozen Python services, moved database from sharded MySQL to early version of Cassandra, replaced nuanced algorithms developed over decade with hack implemented few days before launch. Although Digg likely would have struggled to become profitable due to reliance on SEO for traffic and Google's frequently changing search algorithm, engineering strategy ensured died fast rather than having opportunity to dig way out. Not just Digg - almost every engineering organization has unused platform projects that captured decades of engineering years to detriment of important opportunity. Shocking number of senior leaders join new companies and initiate grand migration attempting to entirely rewrite architecture, switch programming languages, or shift organization to resemble prior organization where understood things better. Term "inappropriate" rather than "bad" - same strategy might be very effective in different circumstances (e.g., if Digg had been three person company with no revenue, rewriting from scratch could have been right decision). Every approach undoubtedly works in some organization. Written strategy drives organizational learning: Example Carta - inconsistent approach to important problems, teams had distinct standard kits, adoption of existing internal platforms inconsistent, decision making around funding new internal platforms inconsistent, widespread agreement decomposing monolith but no agreement on how. Coming into permissive strategy environment with strong differing perspectives, wrote explicit engineering strategy with Navigators team (explicitly named technical leaders representing key parts of engineering organization - representative leadership group made possible to iterate on strategy with small team of about ten engineers representing entire organization rather than negotiate with 400 engineers directly). Written strategy made possible to explicitly describe problems seen and how wanted to navigate them, artifact able to iterate on in small group then share widely for feedback, could revise and update over time (e.g., extending to mention AI/LLMs, then revising again as dive into agentic workflows). Disagreement is feature - lot of people disagreed with parts, great benefit of written strategy is possible to precisely disagree, from disagreement able to evolve strategy (sometimes new information, other times initial approach could be improved). New hires able to disagree from informed place rather than coming across attached to prior company's practices, able to understand historical thinking motivating decisions even when context no longer obvious. With oral history, what you believe highly dependent on who you talk with, shapes view of history and present. With written history, far more possible to agree at scale, prerequisite to growing at scale rather than isolating growth to small pockets of senior leadership. Cost of implicit strategy: Vulnerable to misinterpretation - information flow in verbal organizations depends on individual being in room for decision then accurately repeating to others who need it, common to see fail to repeat elsewhere or interpretation faulty, both create significant problems. "Two-headed organizations" solution - two leaders (manager and senior engineer) to reduce communication errors, errors in point-to-point communication so prevalent one-to-one that only solution for non-reading-oriented communicators was ensuring communicated strategy to at least two people. Inconsistency across teams - example: promotions to Staff-plus role happened at much higher rate in infrastructure engineering than product engineering, created constant drain out of product engineering to work on infrastructure-shaped problems even if not valuable to business, new leaders had no idea informal policy existed, routinely ran into trouble in calibration discussions, also weren't aware needed to argue for better policy, worse no one sure if real policy or not so ultimately random whether perspective represented for any promotion (sometimes good promotions blocked, sometimes borderline cases approved). Inconsistency over time - implementing new policy mix of persistent and one-time actions, e.g., standardize all HTTP operations to use same library across codebase (add linter check, one-time pass), but two years later another three random HTTP libraries in codebase creeping into cracks. If policy written down and few people read it, number of ways could be prevented. If not written down, much less likely someone remembers, much less likely remember rationale well enough to argue about it. Hazard to new leadership - when new Staff-plus engineer or executive joins, common to blame them for failing to understand existing context behind decisions (fair: big part of senior leadership uncovering and understanding context, unfair: explicit documentation would have made much easier). Every particularly bad new-leader onboarding involved new leader coming into unfilled role that manager didn't know how to do, success entirely dependent on new leader's ability and interest in learning. Practice of documenting strategy has lot in common with succession planning - full benefits accrue to organization rather than individual doing it, possible to maintain when original authors present, appreciating value requires stepping outside yourself to value things that matter most to organization when you're no longer member. Information herd immunity - frequent objection "no one reads anything", some truth but extremely hard to get everyone to know something, never found that goal particularly important. View of information dispersal same as herd immunity: don't need everyone to know something, just enough people who know something that confusion doesn't propagate too far. Impossible for all engineers to know strategy details, but can have every Staff-plus engineer and engineering manager know those details. Strategy supports personal learning: While largest benefits accrue to organization, strategy is underrated avenue for self-development. (1) Creating strategy builds self-awareness - example: engineers viewing themselves extremely senior but frequently demanded projects implemented using new programming languages/technologies because personally wanted to learn (internal strategy clear - wanted to work on something fun), but following steps to build engineering strategy would have created strategy even they agreed didn't make sense. (2) Strategy supports situational awareness in new environments - Wardley mapping talks about situational awareness as prerequisite to good strategy (ensuring understand realities of circumstances, most destructive failure of new senior engineering leaders), by explicitly stating diagnosis where strategy applied makes easier to debug why reusing prior strategy in new team/company might not work. (3) Strategy as personal archive - documented strategy is institutional memory and personal memory to understand impact of prior approaches, each of us archivist of prior work pulling out valuable pieces to address problem at hand, over long career memory fades and motivated reasoning creeps in but explicit documentation doesn't. Part of reason started working on book now rather than later - realized starting to forget details of strategy work did earlier in career, if wanted to preserve wisdom of that era and ensure didn't have to relearn same lessons, had to write now. Summary: Two key themes most frequently ignored - (1) There's always a strategy even if isn't written down, (2) Single biggest act to further strategy in organization is write down strategy so can be debated, agreed upon, and explicitly evolved. Discussions around strategy often get caught up in high prestige activities like making controversial decisions, but most effective strategists make more progress by performing basics: writing things down, exploring widely to see how other companies solve same problem, accepting feedback into draft from folks who disagree. Strategy is useful, and doing strategy can be simple too.

### Follow Culture First, Don't Start by Changing It

- **Source:** Engineering Strategy (learnings.aleixmorgadas.dev)
- **Author:** Aleix Morgadas
- **URL:** https://learnings.aleixmorgadas.dev/p/do-not-start-by-changing-the-culture
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Organizational culture, cultural change, middle management, engineering leadership, culture dimensions, organizational behavior, change management
- **Key Insight:** Start with small processes that eventually lead to cultural change, rather than trying to change culture directly. For middle management, following the culture is the path of least resistance to achieve goals. Core insight: Aiming to drive company cultural change as middle management is recipe for burnout. Instead, follow the culture - it is path for less resistance to achieve what you aim to achieve. Understanding culture: Culture refers to shared values, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and practices that define how business operates and how employees interact. Long story short: how decisions are made. Based on Tanya Reilly's "The Staff Engineer's Path," when people ask about culture they refer to: How much autonomy will I have? Will I feel included? Will it be safe to make mistakes? Will I be part of decisions that affect me? How difficult will it be to make progress on projects? Are people nice? Culture is how we behave in day to day, how we make decisions, and based on which values. Seven dimensions to describe culture (from Tanya Reilly's book): (1) Secret vs. Open - How much does everyone know? Information is currency? Calendars private? Slack channels invitation only? Everyone has access to everything? Even messy first drafts? (2) Oral vs. Written - What gets shared by word of mouth vs written down? How much writing and review involved in decisions? Features come with formal specifications or need to go to person who made feature? (3) Top-down vs. Bottom-up - Where do initiatives come from? Bottom-up culture where employees/teams empowered to make own decisions and champion initiatives they think important, but when need support they slow down. (4) Fast vs. Deliberate - Rapid decisions and pivot abruptly to try new opportunity, or need to show thought through whole plan before executing? (5) Back channels vs. Front doors - How do people in different groups talk? Formal path via teams' managers, or people can send friendly DMs cross teams? (6) Allocated vs. Available - How much time does everyone have? Teams understaffed or overworked? Able to absorb new work as appears, or ends in backlog needs prioritized in next cycle? (7) Liquid vs. Crystallized - Where do power, status, reputation come from? How gain trust? Clear hierarchy? In specific point in hierarchy, as others move up you also move? Or more Liquid, offers room for change, need to move yourself to be promoted. Understanding your culture first: Two common responses when asking leaders about culture: (1) "That's not the type of company I want to be part of," (2) "That's why we're not able to drive necessary change, culture isn't helping us, need to change it first so can do necessary changes later." Culture never black or white, grey scale in multiple levels. Describe differently for overall company culture vs tribe's vs team's. Two scenarios for improving culture: C-level (CTO/CIO) vs Middle management (VPs, Heads of Engineering, Engineering Managers, Staff/Principal Engineers). Focus on middle management where driving cultural change more challenging. The middle management challenge: When talking to middle managers and Principal Engineers, challenges often not about culture as goal to accomplish but as blocker to achieve desired outcome. Typical: "I want to drive initiative to accomplish A, but would be easier if had more Y culture. How can I influence leadership to change culture?" Answer: Don't aim to change culture. Cultural change takes time, requires constant leadership support, lot of patience. By time achieved that, challenge now will no longer matter. Instead, follow culture - path for less resistance. If approach/plan/strategy isn't possible due to cultural restrictions, problem is your approach not possible in that context. Need to find another way that fits company's culture way of working. Can mean: need to play company's rules like being in right meetings with right people, or even need to move into management career to influence decisions where it happens. Focus on achieving goals and overcoming challenges within scope of action first. Once in middle of progress, aim to influence culture as part of journey. Cultural change is part of process: Best way to influence company culture is part of succeeding in high stake business challenges. Shouldn't aim for highly disruptive new way of working, but "the adjacent possible." Example: If part of organization with top-down approach, secretive, oral-based communication, can start influencing by driving initiative making information available and written, but keeping approach top-down. Don't want to change too many ways of doing stuff at same time. When you succeed: (1) Achieve business objectives first, delivering company and customer value, (2) Create trust between all parties (high level leadership and teams), (3) Show that by doing X, Y, Z achieved objectives. Company's love success, we all try to repeat success. Next time face similar challenge, default approach will be new ways of working. When you fail: (1) Learn why failed - don't blame culture, understand why approach didn't succeed, then adapt methods and try new approaches, (2) Don't create high resistance to change due to disruptive new ways of working - can prevent any new improvement initiatives in future. Worst: people stop believing in change. Make it iterative: Don't try to change everything at once. Make small, incremental changes that fit within existing culture. As succeed with these changes, they become new default, gradually shifting culture. Aim for "adjacent possible" - changes one step away from where are, not massive disruptions. Reduces resistance, increases chances of success. Iterative approach: (1) Understand culture using 7 dimensions, (2) Identify smallest change moving toward goal, (3) Make that change within existing cultural constraints, (4) Succeed or learn from failure, (5) Repeat with next adjacent change. Key takeaways: Culture is how decisions made - understand first before trying to change. Use 7 dimensions to map organization culture. For middle management, follow culture first - aiming to drive cultural change directly is recipe for burnout. If approach doesn't fit, problem is your approach - find another way that fits. Cultural change happens through success - influence by succeeding in high-stake business challenges using new ways of working. Aim for adjacent possible - small incremental changes rather than disruptive transformations. Make it iterative - one step at a time, building on each success. Success creates trust and new defaults - when companies see success with new approaches, become default for future challenges. Failure is learning not blame - understand why approaches fail and adapt, don't blame culture. Avoid creating resistance - disruptive changes can prevent future improvement initiatives.

### Build vs Buy: Experimentation Platforms

- **Source:** Statsig Blog
- **Author:** Statsig
- **URL:** https://www.statsig.com/articles/build-vs-buy
- **Date:** Published on Statsig
- **Key Concepts:** Experimentation platforms, A/B testing infrastructure, build vs buy, total cost of ownership, opportunity cost, product experimentation, variant assignment, data processing, experiment analysis
- **Key Insight:** Framework for deciding whether to build an in-house experimentation platform or buy/rent one from external provider. Context: Companies like Bing, Google, LinkedIn increased experiments by order of magnitude after building platforms, run tens of thousands per year. Large tech companies have dedicated teams, but must decide based on business context. Two key questions: (1) What would it cost to build your own platform? (2) What can external platform deliver? Building your own requires investment in three areas: (1) Reliable core infrastructure to control and execute experiments, (2) Analysis framework to make sense of data and product decisions, (3) SDKs and tools to integrate with existing software development and decision-making processes. Core infrastructure has four components: (1) Experiment Control - persists and validates experiment specifications including iterations, parameters (start/end dates, control/variants, target users, sample sizes, configuration), enforces approval workflows, roles/permissions ensuring only approved experiments run, only authorized members start/stop. (2) Variant Assignment - decides how to assign user request to variant based on experiment specification and pseudo-random hash. Important considerations: random but deterministic assignment (users don't switch experiences), assigning users across multiple concurrent experiments ensuring consistent experience, keeping experiments isolated (one user not simultaneously in multiple conflicting experiments), delivering assignments without additional latency or hurting application availability. (3) Data Processing - reliable automated data processing critical for organizational trust. Steps: consolidate/sort/join logs from different sources, cleanse and enrich logs, compute metrics for segments/user dimensions, calculate p-values and confidence intervals. Critical: run A/A tests to ensure correctness, run basic health checks. (4) Experiment Analysis - enable everyone to easily read/interpret results. Separates valuable platform from one discarded quickly. Essential features: clear concise results highlighting relative change in metrics with statistical significance signals, must provide confidence intervals (platforms that don't are amusing at best, misleading/damaging at worst), reveal all relevant metrics not just experiment-tailored one, enable slicing across user dimensions/segments, use lower p-values to filter most significant metrics, per metric views of all experiment results to see most impactful experiments. APIs and SDKs: Experiment configurations must reach applications via APIs/SDKs. Considerations: support for client-side or server-side production decisioning, support for all languages teams choose, SDKs resilient to network flakiness, API versioning carefully considered with existing SDK usage. Buying/Renting considerations: (1) Core Functionality - delivers needed functionality? Optimized for front-end or back-end? Works for web and mobile? (2) SDK Support - supports SDK in needed language? (3) Performance - do SDK calls slow application? (4) Data Ingestion - can ingest from different sources to avoid logging with multiple services, join data for richer analysis? (5) Near Real-time Results - need near-real time to quickly detect/stop bad experiments? (6) Randomization Unit - allows randomization units like sessions/workspaces in addition to users? (7) Metrics - computes all required metrics? Do metrics reconcile with other company sources? (8) Health & Audit - automatically surfaces health/system metrics to proactively identify issues? Provides approval workflows for team reviews? Provides audit log of changes? (9) Access Control - allows controlling who has permissions to start/stop experiments? Building vs Buying: Estimate how many experiments organization would run assuming everyone embraces experimentation. As experiments scale, infrastructure becomes increasingly complex. To decide, consider TCO and opportunity cost of building in-house vs functional needs, reliability, scalability, costs of external service. Total Cost of Ownership for in-house: (1) Development - requires top-notch infrastructure engineers for high availability/performance, dedicated data scientists/data engineers for reliable trustworthy data processing/computations/results. (2) Operations & Support - team needs on-call rotation for uptime SLAs, support inquiries/tickets from all company users. (3) Infrastructure - must be redundant/resilient with automated scaling for stable trusted service, include monitoring/operational tooling, near-real time results increases complexity/cost further. (4) SDKs for Everyone - each team requires client/server SDKs in preferred language, platform team needs engineers familiar with language nuances to build/support SDKs over time. Opportunity Cost: Building in-house comes at expense of engineers/dollars that could invest in core product/functionality users want. Good experimentation platform accelerates innovation pace. If slows client teams, they won't use it and initial investment wasted. If decide to build, must invest in team/infrastructure/SDKs to stay ahead of all client teams' needs. External service advantage: Assuming external service meets functional requirements, buying may offer faster innovation pace than in-house. External services committed to innovating on behalf of all customers and setting industry standards for scalability, performance, security, governance. Means enjoy leading innovation pace in experimentation by default. When building might be better: Some cases building better if external services don't meet functional requirements. Example: Software deeply integrated with hardware (e.g., Roku) may need unique/customized way to deploy/control experiments. Summary: External service helps focus on driving car rather than assembling platform parts. For flexibility, consider service with free tier and easy onboarding to see value of simple A/B tests without contracts. Get something that works day one, most importantly provides transparent pricing so only get what need.

### Using Cultural Survey Data

- **Source:** Irrational Exuberance (lethain.com)
- **Author:** Will Larson (Author of "An Elegant Puzzle," "Staff Engineer," "The Engineering Executive's Primer," and "Crafting Engineering Strategy")
- **URL:** https://lethain.com/using-cultural-survey-data/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Original Source:** This is an unedited chapter from O'Reilly's "The Engineering Executive's Primer"
- **Key Concepts:** Cultural surveys, employee feedback, survey analysis, data literacy, executive accountability, organizational culture, team trust, survey action planning, survey frequency
- **Key Insight:** How to effectively read, analyze, and take action on cultural survey results to build trust and address team concerns. Context: Almost every scaled company runs cultural surveys (vendors like CultureAmp or Lattice, or in-house tools). Surveys ask about experience working in company, cross-team collaboration, compensation, etc. Results tallied, reports generated for each manager about their team, executive team gets company-wide report. Senior leaders usually don't spend much time on survey results, but they're great lens into data literacy and how leaders prioritize limited resources to address broad problem space. Valuable mechanism for earning credibility by following through to address concerns. Reading results: Quick advice - spend couple hours digesting results, focus more on absolute scores than relative (high score still high even if relatively down), identify all issues not just first couple noticed. Formalized 10-step approach: (1) Check access - ensure whole company access not just engineering report, executive team should see full results (transparency helps gel executive team, see cross-functional patterns like Engineering and Product both frustrated, identify areas other functions frustrated with Engineering). (2) Create private document for notes - screen capture data raising issues, add commentary, staging ground not final product. (3) Understand population sizes - build intuition for statistical significance (changes significant in org of 2,000 but technical program manager team of 7, extreme change probably not significant). Be skeptical of narratives - survey tools incentivized to produce narratives even if weak, cautiously skeptical of analysis lacking statistical significance, use comments/follow-ups rather than raw numbers for non-significant findings. (4) Skim and categorize - group into three categories: things to celebrate, things to proactively address, things to acknowledge. Capture highlights in addition to concerns (never want purely negative update). (5) Check previous investments - how did you perform on areas identified after last survey? Highlight success, form hypothesis if didn't have impact. (6) Focus on extremes - highest and lowest absolute ratings, have they changed, did you expect them to change? (7) Focus on rapid changes - ratings changing fastest, what's driving rapid shift? (8) Compare across cohorts - different managers, tenure, gender, location. (9) Read every comment - copy most relevant to notes, what subjective feedback changes interpretation, what comments to quote when sharing summary. (10) Discuss with peer - spend hour with peer (e.g., head of product) after they've reviewed their report. Identify connected themes across orgs, find gaps in analysis. Don't do with direct report (messy discussing peers, avoid thorniest issues). Taking action: Problem - teams spend time running/analyzing but never use analysis for anything (frustrates team, trains them to ignore future surveys). Other extreme - earnest leaders commit to fixing everything (team loves initially, but six months later little progress). Middle path - identify few important areas where can make real progress, actually do work. Standard pattern: (1) Address acute issues immediately - manager whose team in open revolt, ethical issue raised. (2) Select 2-3 investment areas - use analysis notes, invest until next survey (e.g., increasing representation for Staff-plus engineers in key decision making forums, increasing sense of belonging for remote employees). (3) Create shareable document - edit notes and investment areas into document comfortable sharing, err on transparent but optimistic transparency (things relatively down often still absolutely high, recent trend down important but still significantly higher than historical averages). (4) Review with multiple stakeholders - direct reports (team meeting), People/HR partner, peers on executive team, 2-3 trusted individual contributors within Engineering (more sensitive to issues easier to miss as executive). (5) Incorporate feedback carefully - reviewers always find something important missed, listen carefully even if doesn't initially resonate. (6) Define explicit, verifiable actions - abstract commitments don't build trust, ambiguous whether followed through. (7) Share and discuss - share document with organization, schedule meeting to discuss findings and priorities with entire engineering organization (often repurpose Engineering Q&A sessions). (8) Follow up monthly - progress against action items (often include in weekly updates). (9) Mention improvements next survey - team takes survey more seriously if know you took action last time, helps score higher on questions about making improvements, new hires won't know if improvements made unless do this. Outcome: Straightforward process builds team trust and stronger culture. Executives rarely held accountable unless expose themselves to accountability. Valuable opportunity to hold yourself accountable to team. As hold yourself accountable, becomes easier to hold team accountable. Questions to ask: Executive teams debate adding questions every time survey about to run. While important to ensure good coverage, generally default questions good enough, not worthwhile to change. Two types of data: (1) Ratings on questions - valuable because can compare across cohorts, more useful seeing trends over time. Expensive to change - each change wipes out historical context, changes from default mean can't compare against industry benchmarks. Recommend against changing unless folks frequently confused (e.g., confusion between "the Management Team" vs "your manager" - executive team refers to itself as "Management Team" but wider company doesn't know, confusion invalidates results so change for clarity more valuable than preserving continuity). (2) Free-form responses - provide subjective context. Relatively cheap to change - no history to wipe out. However, if folks have something to say, they'll say it anywhere even if question somewhat unrelated. Adding more free-form questions doesn't change that, so as long as handful of open-ended questions, don't worry about adding more. Conclusion: Worth evaluating questions before first rollout, but repeated arguments about changing questions is executive bikeshedding. Starting and frequency: When to start - small organizations with genuine relationship with every team member won't get much from survey. As organization grows, become more useful. Dunbar's number (roughly 150) good point to ensure running surveys. Frequency - most run twice a year, reasonable amount. Principled way to determine: consider how much time willing to invest addressing issues raised. If struggling to address concerns from biannual surveys, doesn't make sense to run more frequently (annoy folks, complain about running another survey before addressing previously raised concerns). It can be uncomfortable: Sometimes embarrassed by scores. Called out for not paying attention to team's priorities. Tried to prioritize remote working experience, regressed rather than improved. Had below average scores and bad scores. Approach: Take moment, be uncomfortable with it. It means you care! Then lean into feedback, use to motivate addressing issues. Key takeaways: (1) Cultural surveys valuable lenses - reveal data literacy and how leaders prioritize limited resources. (2) Reading results requires structure - systematic approach: check access, create notes, understand population sizes, categorize, compare, read comments, discuss with peers. (3) Focus on absolute scores - high score still high even if relatively down. (4) Be skeptical of narratives - survey tools incentivized to produce narratives, cautiously skeptical especially of analysis lacking statistical significance. (5) Take action on 2-3 areas - don't commit to fixing everything but don't ignore results. (6) Be transparent and optimistic - share broadly but frame optimistically. (7) Define explicit, verifiable actions - abstract commitments don't build trust. (8) Follow up monthly - regular updates build trust. (9) Don't change questions unnecessarily - preserve historical context and industry benchmarking. (10) Start around 150 people (Dunbar's number). (11) Run twice a year typically - frequency should match capacity to address concerns. (12) Embrace discomfort - bad scores uncomfortable but means you care, use as motivation.

### Why Your Company Needs Junior Devs

- **Source:** SoftwareDoug Blog (softwaredoug.com)
- **Author:** Doug Turnbull (Consultant and trainer on search applications and LLMs)
- **URL:** https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2024/09/07/your-team-needs-juniors
- **Date:** September 7th, 2024
- **Key Concepts:** Junior engineers, team composition, coaching, knowledge creation, psychological safety, innovation, teaching culture, generalists vs specialists, Protege effect, knowledge transfer
- **Key Insight:** The case for hiring junior engineers. BigTech trend of only hiring elite Staff devs misses the mark - coaching junior employees becomes force multiplier for innovating at scale. Not about added labor, but psychologically safe culture valuing teaching/learning that unlocks innovation. Junior talent forces team to teach, coach, collaborate - key insight from Nonaka and Takeuchi's "The Knowledge-Creating Company": Japanese companies out-innovated Western in 80s/90s because focused on knowledge. Making personal knowledge available to others is central activity of knowledge-creating company. Innovative companies prioritize teaching, spreading, sharing knowledge - ingraining knowledge into company DNA matters more than single developer shipping brilliant feature. Knowledge discovery IS innovation. Teaching helps not just juniors but seniors too - "Protege effect" well-studied phenomenon where teacher's knowledge deepens when required to teach. Juniors force-multiply seniors not by writing code but by forcing seniors to teach and rethink knowledge. Redundancy (overlap in focus area) undergirds this - encourages frequent dialogue/communication, creates "common cognitive ground" facilitating transfer of tacit knowledge. Juniors become this redundancy - absorb company tribal knowledge, reprocess it, internalize it, translate to explicit knowledge, help seniors become aware of assumptions/question/refine them, act as Socratic dialog ensuring on right path. Also practical benefits: fixing bugs, being on-call at 3AM so senior devs don't collapse from burnout. Generalists innovate better than specialists - argument from book "Range". Wright Brothers classic example (non-expert bicycle mechanics invent flying machine), NoSQL databases from distributed systems tinkerers not relational database experts. Juniors ask "dumb" questions - experts through ego/blindness don't see obvious solutions, don't question tacit assumptions. Juniors eagerly crash into/through problems seniors convinced themselves too hard. Juniors try "dumb" things that often fail but sometimes show how blinded experts become from long-held assumptions. Great ideas from junior employees: Jack Dorsey had idea for Twitter as junior employee of podcast company, Post-it notes invented by junior employees Spencer Silver and Art Fry at 3M, Firefox side project of Blake Ross while working at Netscape. Juniors come from more diverse backgrounds than seniors (every sense of word), leading to ways of thinking/perspectives seniors totally miss. Juniors mean psychological safety means more innovation - term from 1999 paper by Amy Edmondson: "Team psychological safety is associated with learning behavior, team efficacy is not" (efficacy = perceived competence). Creating environments where coaching is norm leads to increased psychological safety - team members readily admit mistakes, report errors. Cultures of learning beget psychological safety, psychological safety begets learning, learning and innovation go hand in hand. Contrast with group cohesiveness - stable team of long-term colleagues falls into groupthink, loses ability to innovate, forms immune system to outside ideas/experience. Onboarding anyone (especially juniors) seems annoying chore if colleagues don't enjoy teaching/learning. Entrenched employees live in knowledge silos, not excited to open work to others, lose "learning behavior" muscle. Learning behaviors crucially include ability to experiment - trying new approaches, running more A/B tests, willing to try product directions that don't work out (but sometimes do). Founders talk about "failing fast" but founders/managers can be own worst enemy: wanting only experts who already have all answers, rather than juniors hungry to find new answers. Your org suffers from not hiring juniors - hire juniors that want to learn, hire seniors that want to teach. Those who can't teach, maybe shouldn't be allowed to "do". Ideal team like healthy University research lab - platonic ideal senior open-minded/eager to be challenged, eager to unlearn expertise to find new path. Juniors enthusiastic to absorb knowledge like sponge, asking naive questions that draw out new ideas and shake foundations. High-performing team: individuals open to ideas, eager to share credit, avoid blame, shipping constantly, sharing wins/learnings, believing in team. 50% of puzzle is internal teaching/learning culture, other 50% requires interface to "outside world" that protects team, sells internal chaos as cohesive narrative, works with investors/stakeholders to translate messy experiments into glorious tale of progress. Many executives mistake outer chrome of leadership for entire system, ignoring internal combustion engine of teaching/learning that makes it run.

### Never Rewrite Code From Scratch

- **URL:** https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Code rewriting, refactoring, technical debt, software architecture, legacy code, code maintenance, incremental improvement, software development mistakes
- **Key Insight:** Rewriting code from scratch is "the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make." Famous warning based on Netscape 6.0 rewrite disaster (3 years between releases, market share plummeted). Historical examples: Borland (dBase for Windows, Quattro Pro rewrite), Microsoft (Pyramid project for Word for Windows - shut down). Why programmers want to rewrite: Programmers are architects who want to bulldoze and rebuild, not do incremental renovation. Fundamental law of programming: "It's harder to read code than to write it" - explains why code always seems messy. Why code seems messy: Those "hairs" on functions are actually bug fixes - fixes for edge cases discovered through weeks of real-world usage (Nancy's bug, low memory conditions, floppy disk yanks, old Windows 95 compatibility). Each bug fix represents weeks of discovery plus days of reproduction/fixing. Cost of rewriting: (1) Throw away all knowledge, collected bug fixes, years of programming work. (2) Throw away market leadership - give competitors 2-3 years (long time in software). (3) Can't react to market - stuck shipping old code, can't make strategic changes. (4) Waste money writing code that already exists. Why old code is valuable: Old code has been used, tested, bugs found and fixed. Software doesn't rust. Idea that new code is better is patently absurd. Netscape code may have been "bad" but worked on many real-world systems. What's actually wrong with "messy" code: Three types of problems: (1) Architectural problems - code not factored correctly, can be solved incrementally by moving code, refactoring, changing interfaces. Example: Juno project rearchitected over several months without throwing away code. (2) Inefficiency - only affects small part, can optimize or rewrite just that part. "When optimizing for speed, 1% of work gets 99% of bang." (3) Ugliness - solve with macros, find/replace, not by rewriting. Example: FuckedString data type, underscore vs "m_" conventions. The rebuild fallacy: No reason to believe you'll do better - probably different team, will make same mistakes plus new ones. "Build one to throw away" mantra: Dangerous for large-scale commercial applications. Fine for experimental code (ripping up last week's function, refactoring class) but folly for whole programs. Key insight: Refactor incrementally, don't rewrite. Preserve knowledge while fixing problems.

### Platforms vs Products: The Steve Yegge Rant

- **Source:** GitHub Gist (originally internal Google+ post accidentally made public)
- **Author:** Steve Yegge (worked at Amazon for 6.5 years, Google for 6.5 years)
- **URL:** https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Platforms, products, platform strategy, service-oriented architecture (SOA), APIs, accessibility, Amazon, Google, Jeff Bezos, platform-first thinking, externalizability, "eat your own dogfood", infrastructure as platform
- **Key Insight:** Legendary rant comparing Amazon (platform-first) vs Google (product-first). Core thesis: "A platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product." Amazon's transformation: Jeff Bezos's 2002 mandate forced all teams to expose data/functionality through service interfaces, designed from ground up to be externalizable (exposed to outside developers). Result: Amazon transformed into service-oriented architecture culturally, enabled AWS (infrastructure as platform). Google's failure: Google doesn't "get" platforms - exemplified by Google+ which launched with no API, then one measly API call. Problem is cultural: PMs, engineers, product teams don't get platforms. Internal war between minority "Platformers" vs "Mighty Funded Confident Producters." Key principle: Platforms solve accessibility - you can't build one product right for everyone, but platforms enable third-party developers to build right product for everyone. Accessibility is "the most important thing in computing world" - more important than security (dialing accessibility to zero = no product, security to zero can still have product). The Golden Rule: "Eat Your Own Dogfood" = "Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything." Can't bolt it on later - ten times as much work. Amazon's SOA discoveries at scale: pager escalation harder (20 service calls), every peer team potential DOS attacker (need quotas/throttling), monitoring and QA are same thing (recursive semantics checking), service discovery essential (universal registry), debugging harder (need debuggable sandboxes). Bezos's realizations: (1) Infrastructure can be repurposed as platform (AWS), (2) Can't build right thing for everyone - enable third parties instead. Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook get platforms. Google doesn't. Problem: Google is product company through and through - wild success with search biased them. Solution requires dramatic cultural change - "not getting it" endemic across company. We're trying to predict what people want and deliver it - can't do that reliably. Only few people like Steve Jobs could. Enable others instead. Facebook successful because built entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do work. Platform needs killer app (Facebook itself for Facebook Platform), but serious mistake to conclude app could be successful without platform. Key takeaways: Platforms beat products, platforms solve accessibility, eat your own dogfood, start with platform use it for everything, no cheating (no secret back doors), Bezos's mandate worked, can't predict what people want - enable others, it's cultural problem.

### Avoiding Day 2: Jeff Bezos's Letter to Shareholders

- **Source:** Amazon.com, Inc. SEC Filing (2016 Annual Report)
- **Author:** Jeffrey P. Bezos (Founder and CEO of Amazon.com)
- **URL:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312517120198/d373368dex991.htm
- **Date:** April 2017 (2016 Letter to Shareholders)
- **Key Concepts:** Day 1, Day 2, customer obsession, organizational decline, proxies, process, decision making, execution speed, external trends, long-term thinking, organizational culture
- **Key Insight:** How to fend off "Day 2" - which is stasis, followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating painful decline, followed by death. Always Day 1. Four essentials for Day 1 defense: (1) True customer obsession - customers always beautifully dissatisfied even when happy, desire to delight drives invention (Prime example), requires experiment patiently/accept failures/plant seeds/protect saplings/double down on delight, customer-obsessed culture creates conditions for all that. (2) Resist proxies - as companies grow, tendency to manage to proxies (dangerous, subtle, very Day 2). Process as proxy: good process serves you to serve customers, but process can become the thing, stop looking at outcomes just doing process right, junior leaders defend bad outcomes with "we followed process", experienced leaders investigate/improve process, ask: do we own process or does process own us? Market research as proxy: surveys can become proxies for customers (dangerous when inventing/designing), misleading metrics like "55% satisfied up from 47%", good inventors/designers deeply understand customers (study anecdotes not just averages, live with design), must have vision and love offering, then research helps find blind spots, remarkable experience starts with heart/intuition/curiosity/play/guts/taste (not in surveys). (3) Embrace external trends - outside world pushes to Day 2 if won't/can't embrace trends quickly, fighting trends = fighting future, embrace them = tailwind, trends obvious but hard for large orgs to embrace (e.g., machine learning/AI - shift from automating clear rules to tasks where describing precise rules harder), Amazon examples: Prime Air drones, Amazon Go, Alexa (visible) plus demand forecasting/search ranking/recommendations/fraud detection/translations (beneath surface, quietly improving core operations), AWS lowering barriers so all sizes can take advantage. (4) High-velocity decision making - Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions slowly, need both quality and speed, easy for startups challenging for large orgs. Four principles: (a) Never one-size-fits-all - many decisions reversible (two-way doors), use lightweight process, so what if wrong? (b) 70% information rule - most decisions with 70% of information wish had (not 90%), need good at recognizing/correcting bad decisions quickly, being wrong less costly than slow if good at course correction. (c) Disagree and commit - saves time, if conviction without consensus say "disagree and commit?", applies both ways (bosses should do too), example: Amazon Studios original Bezos disagreed but committed, much faster than if team had to convince, genuine disagreement/candid expression/quick sincere commitment. (d) Recognize misalignment early/escalate immediately - teams sometimes have different objectives/fundamental views, deep misalignment can't be resolved by discussion/meetings, default resolution without escalation is exhaustion (whoever has stamina wins), example: third-party sellers competing on own product pages, "worn me down" awful process (slow/de-energizing), go for quick escalation. Diagnostic questions: settled for decision quality or mindful of velocity too? Are trends tailwinds? Falling prey to proxies or do they serve you? Delighting customers? Goal: scope/capabilities of large company with spirit/heart of small one, but must choose it. 1997 letter principles: long-term focus (shareholder value over long term, market leadership), make investment decisions for long-term leadership not short-term profitability, measure analytically/jettison failures/step up what works, bold investment decisions (some pay off some don't), cash flows over GAAP accounting, share strategic thought processes, spend wisely/maintain lean culture, balance growth with profitability, focus on hiring/retaining versatile talented employees (compensation weighted to stock options). Key takeaways: Day 2 is death (stasis→irrelevance→decline→death, always Day 1), true customer obsession (customers beautifully dissatisfied, drives invention), resist proxies (process/research become proxies, ask who owns what), understand customers deeply (anecdotes not averages), embrace trends (fighting trends = fighting future), high-velocity decisions (quality + speed), no one-size-fits-all (reversible = lightweight), 70% information rule, disagree and commit (both ways), escalate misalignment early, long-term focus, maintain lean culture.

### Technical Hype and Cold Showers

- **Source:** Awesome Cold Showers (GitHub Repository)
- **Author/Curator:** Hillel Wayne (hwayne)
- **URL:** https://github.com/hwayne/awesome-cold-showers
- **Date:** Repository created and maintained (continually updated)
- **Key Concepts:** Technical hype, over-engineering, reality checks, microservices, big data systems, scaling, performance benchmarking, technical decision-making
- **Key Insight:** Curated collection of rigorous and respectful "cold showers" on overhyped technical topics. Premise: It's great when people get excited, but sometimes they get too excited - these are reminders to stay grounded. Not meant to dismiss enthusiasm, but to provide reality checks. For startups: Following technical hype can lead to over-engineering, premature optimization, choosing complex solutions for problems you don't have, wasting time/resources. Key examples: (1) Microservices - Five fallacies of why microservices solve problems monoliths have, shows either monoliths don't have those problems or microservices make them worse. Lesson: Start with monolith, microservices solve scaling/organizational problems you likely don't have yet, add significant operational complexity. (2) Scalability COST paper - Benchmarking graph-processing algorithms on 128-core clusters vs single-threaded 2014 Macbook Pro, laptop consistently wins (sometimes by order of magnitude). Lesson: "If using big data system for yourself, see if faster than your laptop. If building big data system for others, see it's faster than my laptop." Many startups over-invest in distributed systems when single server suffices. Scale when actually need to scale, not before. (3) Scaling SQLite to 4M QPS - Expensify found single bare-metal server faster and cheaper than x1e.32xlarge EC2 instance, avoided sharding complexity. Lesson: Don't assume need to scale out or use cloud services - sometimes single powerful server is faster/cheaper, especially avoiding sharding complexity. (4) Agile Methods critique - Review showing some practices (replacing requirements with user stories, lack of proper specification) harmful long run. Lesson: Agile good but imperfect, don't adopt dogma uncritically, some practices cause problems. (5) VM Warmup - Many benchmarks slow down over time, never stabilize, not repeatable due to non-determinism, warmup time important but usually ignored/reported inaccurately. Lesson: Don't trust performance claims without verifying in your context, many improvements don't hold up under realistic conditions. (6) Web Framework Benchmarks - Actual hard data of various combinations under various tasks. Lesson: Look for actual benchmark data not marketing claims, raw numbers in isolation don't tell whole story, need context and trade-offs. (7) Static vs Dynamic Typing - Review of literature showing solid research inconclusive about whether static typing reduces bugs, conclusive research had methodological issues. (8) Formal Verification - Literature review showing formal methods hard to learn, extremely expensive, often miss critical bugs. Three formally verified systems had critical correctness bugs (at system boundaries, not in protocols). (9) Identifier Naming - Research shows no difference in debugging time/quality between abbreviated vs full-word names. Eye-tracking suggests underscore may be processed faster than camelCase but research not definitive. (10) Go Concurrency - Despite claims Go's concurrency easier/less buggy, empirical study found plenty of concurrency bugs in popular Go software (Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC), more than half caused by Go-specific problems. Pattern: Question hype - do we actually have the problem this solves? What's actual evidence not just marketing? What are trade-offs/complexity costs? What if we started simpler? Stay grounded - best decisions based on understanding actual problems, evidence not hype, simplicity over complexity, incremental improvements over rewrites, measured results over isolated benchmarks. Key takeaways: Microservices often solve problems you don't have (start with monolith), big data systems may be slower than laptop (measure before assuming need distributed), scaling out isn't always better (single server can be faster/cheaper), Agile has problems (good but imperfect, don't adopt dogma), performance claims need verification (benchmarks misleading, test in context), question all hype (enthusiasm can lead astray), start simple (add complexity later if needed), measure don't assume (test actual solutions in context), evidence over marketing (rigorous studies not vendor claims), complexity has costs (every technology adds operational/cognitive overhead).

### Engineering a Culture of Psychological Safety

- **Source:** Intercom Blog
- **Author:** John Looney (Former Site Reliability Engineer at Google, part of Team Development group that contributed to Project Aristotle)
- **URL:** https://www.intercom.com/blog/psychological-safety/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Psychological safety, Project Aristotle, team culture, engineering management, team building, respect, innovation, failure, communication, trust
- **Key Insight:** The top indicator of a successful team isn't tenure, seniority or salary levels. It's psychological safety. Based on Project Aristotle findings from Google. Five warning signs of unsafe teams: (1) "If I take a chance, and screw up, it will be held against me" - mistakes held against people, never try to innovate again without explicit permission. (2) "Our team has a strong sense of culture, and it's hard for new people to join" - defending reputation more important than new hires, team/manager don't have your back. (3) "My team is slow to offer help to people who are struggling" - no formal training, no signals it's OK to learn, develop impostor syndrome. (4) "Using my unique skills and talents come second to the objectives of the team" - skills go unused, grow frustrated, drop proposals without discussion. (5) "It's uncomfortable to have open, honest conversations about our team's sensitive issues" - can't discuss root causes, look for new job. Unsafe teams can deliver short-term but eventually break or underperform drastically because people can't introduce change. How to build: (1) Balance culture with openness to change - respect culture but be open to changing it as needed (team working from home needs to change for interns, on-call culture may need professionalization). (2) Balance work people love with work company needs - great managers expand team remit to use engineers' skills rather than just moving poor fits. (3) Make respect part of culture - "the standard you walk past is the standard you accept" (David Morrison), challenge disrespect immediately, politely, in front of everyone. Examples: assumptions about technical ability (female PM with PhD), mocking previous positions, quiet engineers talked over. (4) Make space for people to take chances - innovation time/wiggle weeks (Intercom's 6-week sprints), but not only then, improve ideas rather than discounting them. (5) Make it obvious when team is doing well - celebrate visible success (Post-It goals), celebrate glorious failure (Google storage SRE example - learned more in 3 days than 3 months, toast what was learned). (6) Clear communication and explicit expectations - build systems (SLOs) rather than yelling, ask for specific commitments, make post-mortems learning opportunities not witch-hunts, set expectations upfront. Action steps: (1) Give team short survey, share results, (2) Discuss what "Safety" means, share when felt "unsafe", (3) Build culture of respect & clear communication starting with your actions. Treat psychological safety as key business metric (as important as revenue, cost of sales, uptime). The Karen story: Graduate makes optimization that causes outage, labeled "irresponsible", no one defends her, no training offered, skills go unused, can't discuss problems, leaves company with design that could have saved product. Key takeaways: (1) Psychological safety is #1 indicator of team success, (2) Unsafe teams break eventually, (3) Five warning signs, (4) Balance culture with openness to change, (5) Balance work people love with work company needs, (6) Make respect part of culture, (7) Make space for people to take chances, (8) Celebrate both success and glorious failure, (9) Clear communication and explicit expectations, (10) Treat as business metric.

### Culture Eats Strategy For Breakfast

- **URL:** https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/12/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Company culture, organizational culture, culture engineering, vision/mission/values, scaling startups, team unity, founder leadership, culture reinforcement, anti-fragility
- **Key Insight:** Personal journey from skeptic to believer about culture's importance. Core principle: "Culture eats strategy for breakfast, technology for lunch, and products for dinner, and soon thereafter everything else too." Culture is operationalizing of organization's values (Edgar Schein concept), guides employee decisions about technical business decisions and interactions, creates internal coherence. Culture can be engineered - happens whether you want it to or not, DNA of company created by founders through actions not words. Not having culture is a choice - decision to not create culture is choosing what culture will prevail (and not for better). Examples: (1) Cambridge Decision Dynamics failed - not because of technology/product/customers but because no meaningful purpose to create team unity to fight through tough times. (2) Eventbrite - consciously engineered culture, palpable energy/excitement, started with testing for humility in hiring ("no assholes" rule), evolved to "GSD" (Get Stuff Done) attitude, "you can't complain here - if you see something wrong, you must fix it" rule, anything can be changed/we own the culture, result: $2B in tickets sold, super-responsive support team. (3) IBM - three core values (respect for individual, superlative customer service, pursuit of excellence), reinforced through training (often two years), monthly communications, performance-appraisal system, role models, every decision, made company great in 1980s/early 1990s. Decline came from erosion of management commitment to values (cutting corners for short-term objectives), ambiguity about values contributed to fall, led to Lou Gerstner as CEO who said "I came to see in my time at IBM that culture isn't just one aspect of the game – it is the game. In the end an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value." (4) Kayak - unique culture from Paul English, culture of excellence/productivity from hiring through operations, three-person meeting maximum (no more wasting time), culture of action and accountability trading off consensus, reinforced daily through behavior/conference room size/incentive system, made no apologies for culture not working for everyone, result: $1.25M revenue per employee (double industry average), sold for $1.8B to Priceline. (5) Dyn - founders believed deeply in strong culture, environment exceptional at allowing honesty about mistakes, driving rectification, celebrating/immortalizing technical efforts, made visible through real estate/visitor handling/leadership actions/movie posters (example: customer broken workflow solution made it "even your parents can figure it out", poster signed by team permanently hung in headquarters), result: grew from 53 employees (2011) to 300 employees, success in unconventional location. Culture creates anti-fragility (Nassim Taleb concept) - positive culture takes inherently fragile human system and makes it anti-fragile (gets stronger with random events), strong product plan great but takes strong culture to handle adverse scenarios positively, unpredictable world of fast-growing startup with daily decisions makes venture stronger rather than weaker/confused. Key takeaways: (1) Culture matters more than strategy/technology/products, (2) Culture can be engineered, (3) Culture is operationalized values, (4) Not having culture is a choice, (5) Founders create culture through actions not words, (6) Culture must be reinforced consistently, (7) Culture creates anti-fragility, (8) Different cultures work for different companies, (9) Culture must be visible, (10) Start with hiring, (11) Culture enables scaling, (12) "Culture is the game" (Gerstner).

### Habits of High-Functioning Teams

- **Source:** deniseyu.io
- **Author:** Denise Yu (Engineer and sketchnoter)
- **URL:** https://deniseyu.io/2020/05/23/habits-of-high-performing-teams.html
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** High-performing teams, psychological safety, software development hygiene, team communication, experience distribution, code documentation, generous communication, team dynamics
- **Key Insight:** Documented characteristics and habits of highest-performing teams based on direct experience working with hundreds of developers. Four key habits: (1) High psychological safety - observable behaviors: regular retrospectives with real issues (not just sunshine/rainbows), explicit/implicit "struggle timebox" for asking help without judgment, individuals dissociate value from visible output ("Here's what we delivered" vs "Here's what I delivered"), people take more PTO/sick time (symptom of alignment/trust). Process experiments possible when high safety (example: Feedback Week - one-week process where everyone randomly assigned to collect feedback for another, created self-reinforcing positive feedback cycle). True psychological safety goes deeper than training - requires understanding invisible social structures, social privilege, how they affect participation, otherwise microaggressions/stereotype threat/survivorship bias manifest. (2) Good hygiene practices - Woods Theorem: "As complexity of system increases, accuracy of any single agent's model decreases rapidly." Can't have comprehensive mental model of large systems, rely on artifacts left by previous developers. Good hygiene = taking extra time to record present-day context: descriptive commit messages (at minimum verb, some teams require issue numbers), intention-revealing class/method names following conventions, unit tests with helpful descriptions/realistic variable names, keeping communication in tracking issues not Slack DMs. About empathy - for teammates (cleaner artifacts = less context-switching) and future self (3am pager pay-off). (3) Active redistribution of "experience points" - RPG analogy (Fire Emblem/Pokemon): level up characters evenly, don't let high-level characters hog experience from low/mid-level. In software: every new piece of work spreads domain context and confidence, don't constantly deploy only senior developers to tackle difficult stories, healthy teams engage in context redistribution so less experienced engineers gain valuable experience points. No central tactician role (managers/PMs don't count - not enough visibility/context, bad to centralize on one person). Raises productivity and morale if everyone feels somewhat equipped to tackle challenges, or knows can ask for help. (4) Communicating generously - Robustness principle (Nat Friedman): "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept." Principle of charity. Codebar mentor training: "Assume every student has limited information, but infinite intelligence." Assume peer is competent/intelligent/reasonable asking question because lacking context, has already attempted to procure on own. Frustrating to have context/experience "rounded down" constantly (gendered element). Examples: Lack of generosity - assume questioner doesn't know basics, provide articles on fundamentals, creates friction. Generosity - check assumptions first ("I'm guessing you're asking about... Stop me if wrong"), gets to solution faster, fewer words, no unnecessary friction, united in slaying uncertainty rather than jousting over knowledge levels. Key takeaways: (1) High psychological safety enables process experiments, (2) Goes deeper than training (social structures/privilege), (3) Observable behaviors (retros with real issues, struggle timebox, value separated from output, more PTO), (4) Good hygiene is empathy, (5) Hygiene practices (descriptive commits, intention-revealing names, helpful tests, context in issues), (6) Redistribute experience points, (7) No central tactician, (8) Communicate generously (assume competence), (9) Check assumptions first, (10) Generosity creates positive cycles.

### Principles Trump Processes

- **Source:** Joseph Jude Blog (jjude.com)
- **Author:** Joseph Jude (Coach and writer)
- **URL:** https://www.jjude.com/principles-trumps/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Strategic thinking, principles vs processes, fundamentals, cargo cult practices, tools vs understanding, context-dependent solutions
- **Key Insight:** If you want to last longer in a field with respect, focus on fundamental principles governing it. Don't copy the visible at the cost of principles. Photography analogy: cameras/lenses/filters are visible and easy to discuss, but lighting/composition/creativity (fundamentals) are hardest and many photographers ignore them. Examples of copying visible instead of principles: focusing on fonts/colors instead of content, rolling out Jira without PM training, copying Steve Jobs' turtlenecks, tuning logo instead of PMF, adopting microservices because Dropbox does, buying Apple stock because Buffett does. Tamil movie comedy scene: Senthil copies Goundamani's words ("she was a mother to all of us") without understanding context, uses same words at wife's funeral ("she was a wife to all of us") - hilarious mistake showing danger of copy-paste without understanding. Latest trends/tools/practices are visible, easy to copy, good for cocktail party talks, but when context changes you're handicapped. Principles are opposite - nobody enjoys challenging cemented beliefs, but principles determine whether you thrive or fade away. David Ogilvy example: man had $500 for hotel opening, Ogilvy understood marketing principles, used simple postcards sent to local telephone directory, hotel opened with full house. If you understand principles well, can use any tool to achieve results. If know principles well, you'll be further than those using tool without understanding underlying tenets. What's on surface (tools/processes) churns faster. If want to last longer in field with respect, focus on fundamental principles. Key takeaways: (1) Focus on principles not processes, (2) Principles endure processes churn, (3) Understand principles to use any tool, (4) Cost of copying visible leaves you handicapped, (5) Principles determine success, (6) Harder but worth it, (7) Examples of mistake (fonts/colors, tools without training, copying style, tuning logo, adopting architectures blindly, following investments), (8) The test - are you copying visible patterns without understanding?, (9) Photography analogy, (10) Senthil mistake shows copy-paste danger.

### No Brilliant Jerks

- **URL:** https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-11-13/brilliant-jerks.html
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Brilliant jerks, team composition, toxic employees, company culture, no asshole rule, psychological safety, workplace harassment, team productivity
- **Key Insight:** The engineering jerk who is brilliant but treats others like trash. Why they cost more than they're worth. Two types: (1) Alice (selfless) - brilliant engineer who cares about company, direct/honest, lacks empathy, browbeats others, great at individual work, gets along with immediate team but known as jerk outside team, great at unglamorous work, debatable whether to tolerate (startups may tolerate). (2) Bob (selfish) - brilliant engineer who cares only about Bob, selfish/lacks empathy/delusions of grandeur, charming/charismatic to get way. Bob's behaviors: interrupts/ignores opinions (silences less-assertive engineers), only does work benefiting himself (creates projects claims credit leaves dirty work, never mentors), bullies/humiliates/oppresses (bamboozles non-technical, ridicules juniors, makes people beg for help, shames mistakes), displays dominance (late to meetings on purpose, puts feet up, ignores others, obscene remarks, insists on better equipment), asserts authority over all areas (denigrates areas can't control), negative (trash-talks technologies/companies/people, elevates status by slamming others), manipulates/misleads (presents facts misleadingly, lies confidently, states opinions as facts), physical intimidation (glares, invades space, slams fists), drives good employees to quit (talented engineers driven out on purpose, demonizes those who left), great talks about himself (rewrites history, takes credit for others' work, hero-worshipped from afar), exploits junior engineers (encourages work elevating Bob reflecting glory, they invest in Bob's career not their own), negative role model (others imitate behavior), coworkers become accomplices/gaslight abuse (enablers defend/deny abuse), refuses to change ("that's their problem"). Problems: Alice - hurts/offends employees, causes team to mend fences, projects less successful, wastes expertise. Bob - silences technical opinions (lowers IQ), creates extra work (abandoned projects), demoralizes staff (hurts productivity), causes stress/illness, increases absenteeism, drives staff to quit (strengthens competition), makes hiring difficult, discourages customers/investors, staff work around Bob (reduces efficiency), staff sabotage Bob's work, inspires imitation (multiplies problem), creates hostile environment (lawsuits). Dealing with: Adopt "no brilliant jerks" policy (Netflix example - "cost to teamwork too high, brilliant people capable of decent human interactions"), policy should come from CEO, Alice might change (if understands hurts company), Bob probably won't (believes "nice guys finish last"), regular one-on-ones/skip-levels help inform management, report to management (don't ask to fire, give information let them decide), share public speaking, for management must be convinced behavior shouldn't be tolerated. Personal story: Author acted like jerk (blunt phone call to engineer who made mistake), manager asked two questions: (1) intend to hurt company?, (2) able to act decently? Questions triggered self-reflection more than accusation. Conclusion: Bob definitely should not be tolerated (can kill companies), Alice debatable, early career author thought jerks worth it (was wrong), policy helps decide ("no brilliant jerks" three words). Fred Wilson quote: "I'd rather have a hole in my organization than an asshole." Key takeaways: (1) Don't tolerate brilliant jerks - cost to teamwork too high, (2) The test - do people feel oppressed/humiliated? Target less powerful?, (3) Two types - Alice (selfless debatable) Bob (selfish definitely not), (4) Bob can kill companies, (5) Adopt policy, (6) Regular one-on-ones help, (7) Alice might change, (8) Bob probably won't, (9) Manager's approach - ask questions not accuse, (10) Fred Wilson quote.

### Don't Pave the Path Used by the Unhappy Cows

- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Culture and technology, tool building culture, microservices, cultural problems, supporting culture, positive feedback loops, automation and culture
- **Key Insight:** The nuance between "don't solve cultural problems with technology" and "be a tool building culture." You can't solve your cultural problems with technology, but you can support your culture with technology. Core insight: "Pave the cow paths, just don't pave the paths used by the unhappy cows." If teams don't respect each other and can't communicate, microservices architecture that decouples deploys won't solve problem, will make it worse - entrench dysfunction deep into code where harder to fix. On flip side, if have culture that already values transparency and inclusion, building tools to make it easier for people with different styles, seniority levels, and geographies to participate reifies that value. Given culture isn't binary, making positive outcomes easiest and default approach creates positive feedback loops. Don't pave unhappy cow paths: teams don't respect each other → microservices won't fix it, teams can't communicate → new tools won't fix fundamental problems, toxic culture → automation won't make it less toxic. Do pave happy cow paths: culture values transparency → build tools making information accessible, culture values inclusion → build tools making participation easier for diverse people, culture values collaboration → build tools making collaboration default/easiest path. Technology should amplify what's working, not try to fix what's broken. Fix culture first, then support it with technology. Tool building culture is still good - but build tools that support good culture, not ones that try to fix bad culture. Key takeaways: (1) Can't solve cultural problems with technology (makes worse, entrenches dysfunction), (2) Can support culture with technology (if culture already values something good, tools reinforce it), (3) Pave cow paths not unhappy cow paths (make good behaviors easier, don't automate bad ones), (4) Fix culture first then support it, (5) Positive feedback loops (making positive outcomes easiest creates reinforcing cycles), (6) Tool building culture still good (but support good culture not fix bad), (7) Microservices example (won't fix communication/respect problems), (8) Transparency example (tools reinforce transparency values), (9) Inclusion example (tools reify inclusion values), (10) Culture isn't binary (technology can help move culture in positive directions).

### Amazon's Leadership Principles

- **Source:** Amazon Jobs
- **Author:** Amazon.com, Inc.
- **URL:** https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles
- **Date:** Current as of 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Leadership principles, organizational culture, decision-making frameworks, operationalized values, Amazon culture, scaling operations, leadership development
- **Key Insight:** The 16 Leadership Principles that Amazon uses every day, whether discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on best way to solve problems. These principles operationalize Amazon's culture - not abstract values but concrete guidelines for how leaders (and all employees) should think and act. The 16 principles: (1) Customer Obsession - start with customer work backwards, earn and keep customer trust, obsess over customers not competitors. (2) Ownership - think like owners, long-term thinking, act on behalf of entire company not just own team, never say "that's not my job". (3) Invent and Simplify - expect innovation and invention, always find ways to simplify, externally aware look for ideas everywhere, not limited by "not invented here", accept being misunderstood when doing new things. (4) Are Right, A Lot - strong judgment and good instincts, seek diverse perspectives, work to disconfirm beliefs. (5) Learn and Be Curious - never done learning, always seek to improve, curious about new possibilities, act to explore them. (6) Hire and Develop the Best - raise performance bar with every hire/promotion, recognize exceptional talent, willingly move talent throughout organization, develop leaders and coach others, invent mechanisms for development. (7) Insist on the Highest Standards - relentlessly high standards (may seem unreasonably high), continually raising the bar, drive high quality in products/services/processes, defects don't get sent down the line, problems fixed so they stay fixed. (8) Think Big - thinking small is self-fulfilling prophecy, create and communicate bold direction, inspire results, think differently, look around corners for ways to serve customers. (9) Bias for Action - speed matters, many decisions reversible, don't need extensive study for everything, value calculated risk taking. (10) Frugality - accomplish more with less, constraints breed resourcefulness/self-sufficiency/invention, no extra points for growing headcount/budget/fixed expense. (11) Earn Trust - listen attentively speak candidly treat respectfully, vocally self-critical (even when awkward/embarrassing), don't believe own hype (body odor doesn't smell like perfume), benchmark against the best. (12) Dive Deep - operate at all levels, stay connected to details, audit frequently, skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ, no task is beneath them. (13) Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit - obligated to respectfully challenge when disagreeing (even when uncomfortable/exhausting), have conviction be tenacious, don't compromise for social cohesion, once decided commit wholly. (14) Deliver Results - focus on key inputs, deliver with right quality timely fashion, rise to occasion despite setbacks, never settle. (15) Strive to be Earth's Best Employer - create safer/more productive/higher performing/diverse/just work environment, lead with empathy, have fun make it easy for others, ask: Are employees growing? Empowered? Ready for what's next? Vision for employees' personal success (at Amazon or elsewhere). (16) Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility - be humble and thoughtful about secondary effects, better every day for customers/employees/partners/world, begin each day with determination to be better, end each day knowing can do even more tomorrow, create more than consume, always leave things better than found. These principles work together and create productive tension: Customer Obsession guides focus, Ownership ensures long-term thinking, Invent and Simplify encourages innovation while maintaining simplicity, Are Right A Lot + Learn and Be Curious + Diverse Perspectives = better decisions, Highest Standards + Bias for Action = high quality fast execution, Think Big + Frugality = ambitious goals with resource constraints, Earn Trust + Dive Deep = credibility through understanding, Have Backbone/Disagree and Commit = strong debate followed by unified execution, Deliver Results = execution focus, Strive to be Earth's Best Employer = people focus, Success and Scale Bring Responsibility = long-term stewardship. Key takeaways: (1) Principles are operationalized culture (used every day for decisions), (2) Customer Obsession is first (everything starts with customer), (3) Ownership mindset (long-term, act for entire company), (4) Invent and simplify (innovation + simplicity), (5) Right judgment through diverse perspectives (seek to disconfirm beliefs), (6) Continuous learning and curiosity, (7) Raising the bar (every hire/promotion raises standards), (8) Unreasonably high standards (relentless quality), (9) Think big (bold direction, thinking small is self-fulfilling), (10) Speed and calculated risk (bias for action), (11) Frugality drives innovation (constraints breed resourcefulness), (12) Earn trust through candor (be self-critical, benchmark against best), (13) Details matter (dive deep, no task beneath you), (14) Disagree then commit (challenge respectfully, commit fully once decided), (15) Deliver results (focus on key inputs, never settle), (16) Be Earth's best employer (lead with empathy, ensure growth), (17) Scale brings responsibility (humble about secondary effects, leave things better).

### Medium's Engineering Values

- **Source:** Medium Engineering (medium.engineering)
- **Author:** Dan Pupius (Founder of Range, previously at Medium and Google)
- **URL:** https://medium.engineering/engineering-values-7143c0db0bd6
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, distributed authority, individual empowerment, engineering culture, team growth, mentorship, diversity and inclusion, leadership, engineering practices
- **Key Insight:** Set of engineering values for distributed authority and individual empowerment. To facilitate distributed authority, need alignment around common values and goals - otherwise regress into command and control systems. As organization grows, values become less obvious and harder to communicate. Values discerned from talking with and observing engineers. Six core values: (1) Professional & personal growth is more important than team stability - fluid organization where engineers work on different parts of product and platforms, roles not static (help people grow and change), engineers have input into product direction and which projects work on. Trade-off: prioritizes individual growth over stable static team structures, recognizes people's interests/skills evolve. (2) Everyone is a mentor; human connection is the path to bringing out the best in people - face-to-face contact with whole team important, every engineer should have regular 1:1s with "manager", peer mentorship promoted and encouraged. Philosophy: mentorship not reserved for seniors/managers, everyone can mentor and learn, human connection essential (direct personal interaction, not just process/tools). (3) Excellent teams require diversity & inclusiveness - diverse team important (gender/ethnicity/personality type/experiences/skills), exposes new perspectives and ideas, balance between continuity and variety with whom you work, cliques and factions harmful and corrosive, give each other benefit of the doubt, always remain civil. Value: diversity essential for excellent teams (not just nice-to-have), different perspectives come from different backgrounds/experiences/ways of thinking, diversity must be coupled with inclusiveness (benefit of doubt, remain civil, avoid cliques). (4) Good leaders are active and supportive - leadership comes in many forms. Support at different levels: junior engineers given adequate support and guidance, mid-level engineers given opportunities that challenge and allow growth (allow them to fail safely), senior engineers have varied opportunities for leadership (people management, technical leadership, product direction). Approach: good leaders active (don't just manage, actively support and develop), recognize different engineers need different things at different stages, leadership not limited to people management. (5) Good engineers are rigorous and resolute - simple is better than clever. Elements: try to be proactive over reactive, value well-communicated critical analysis of solutions, use metrics to make good decisions but aren't beholden to them, don't require consensus but do try to get people on same page. Balance: rigor (well-communicated critical analysis, using metrics) but also resolution (simple over clever, proactive over reactive, get on same page without requiring full consensus). (6) Pursuit of greatness is a virtue - quality and velocity are not diametrically opposed. Elements: technology can enable design that hasn't yet been imagined, design may require technology that hasn't yet been invented, want to pave the way in how engineering teams operate and function, want to inspire other engineering teams, team can be one of the best engineering teams. Aspiration: greatness isn't about perfectionism or sacrificing speed, quality and velocity can coexist, technology and design push each other forward, team can be excellent and inspiring to others. How values work together: distributed authority requires alignment (avoid chaos, need alignment around values/goals), growth over stability creates dynamic organization, human connection enables growth (mentorship not process alone), diversity enables excellence (diverse teams with inclusive culture create better outcomes), supportive leadership enables growth (environments where people grow/fail safely/take challenges), rigor enables quality (good practices enable quality without sacrificing speed), greatness is aspirational (motivates while recognizing quality and velocity coexist). Key takeaways: (1) Distributed authority requires value alignment, (2) Growth over stability, (3) Everyone is a mentor, (4) Diversity and inclusiveness enable excellence, (5) Give benefit of the doubt, (6) Support at all levels, (7) Fail safely, (8) Leadership comes in many forms, (9) Simple over clever, (10) Metrics as tools not masters, (11) Get on same page don't require consensus, (12) Quality and velocity coexist, (13) Technology and design push each other, (14) Aspire to be best, (15) Values are not immutable.

### Lullabot's Engineering Values

- **Source:** Lullabot (lullabot.com)
- **Author:** Lullabot Engineering Team
- **URL:** https://www.lullabot.com/engineering-values
- **Date:** Published on Lullabot website (ongoing)
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, team culture, people-centered engineering, inclusivity, accessibility, learning and sharing, open source, code quality, maintainability, automation, joy in work
- **Key Insight:** Set of engineering values for guiding team work and interactions. Values overlap and expand on Core Values - not a hierarchy or tree - used to ground decisions when solutions aren't obvious or there's conflict. Six core values: (1) People matter more - build systems and processes for people first (systems that burn out teams aren't successful even if on time/budget), tools are means not ends (awareness of limitations), value human safety and security, don't actively harm any group, draw on empathy to build equitably empowering products considering unintended consequences. (2) Cultivate inclusivity - diversity and inclusion have impact on technical level, overarching goal to identify or be experts/advocates for people not directly represented on teams (seek out end-user voice), work towards equitable teams reflecting diverse world, continuously evaluate and respond (missing voices different per project), build accessible products (software should function for everyone), educate clients about accessibility, use accessible tools and language in documentation so differently-abled people can work on both sides of keyboard. (3) Learn and share - work fulfilling because always learning new things, prefer new unsolved problems over applying same solutions, learning and sharing woven through all work day by day, best engineering from sharing and building together as group, embrace open-source software and processes, open code-review keeps innovating and saves reinventing wheel, integrate collaboration into daily work creating space to ask for help and be generous with knowledge. (4) Excellence balances perfect and done - balance between getting things done and architectural zen, consider diminishing returns when solving tricky problems, iterate using real-world feedback and quantitative results (not create in isolation), tactical engineering measures okay (some projects need measures not meant to last), stop and discuss when discover new information, partner with clients to find what works best (not all scenarios ideal). (5) Code for the future - think about big picture before important decisions, good systems last because maintainable and maximize client value, others will inherit work (sometimes "future us"), optimize code for future readers (even if more verbose language, limit uncommon language features), automation gratifying but not always right (can reduce technical debt/make robust/save time but can add complexity/waste time), just because can automate doesn't mean should. (6) Work joy into work - technical challenges as fun puzzles to solve (try things break things try again), come back each day because enjoy tinkering with systems, strive to leave room for joy even with tight deadlines and exacting requirements, joy empowers finding possibilities instead of problems and accepting criticism with open mind, find something to smile about even in extreme challenges (new skill, helpful teammate, wistfully deleting code loved), smile in face of adversity frees finding elegant solutions to toughest problems. How values work together: people-centered (all start with people), practical balance (acknowledge realities, tactical measures okay, perfection not goal), long-term thinking (code for future, sustainable systems), collaboration and sharing (woven through everything), positive attitude (find joy and possibilities). Key takeaways: (1) People matter more than systems (burned out teams = unsuccessful project), (2) Tools are means not ends, (3) Consider unintended consequences (empathy and equity), (4) Advocate for missing voices, (5) Inclusivity is technical (accessibility products/tools/language), (6) Learning woven through everything, (7) Open collaboration creates better engineering, (8) Balance perfect and done (excellence is balance using real feedback), (9) Tactical measures okay, (10) Optimize for future readers (including "future us"), (11) Can doesn't mean should (automation), (12) Leave room for joy (even with tight deadlines), (13) Joy enables elegant solutions (find possibilities not problems), (14) Values aren't hierarchy (overlap and expand), (15) Use values to ground decisions (when solutions not obvious or conflict).

### Figma's Engineering Values

- **Source:** Figma Blog (figma.com/blog)
- **Author:** Thomas Wright (Engineering Manager, Figma)
- **URL:** https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-engineering-values/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, scaling engineering teams, descriptive vs aspirational values, tradeoffs in values, collaboration, mentorship, inclusion, craftsmanship, impact prioritization
- **Key Insight:** Four engineering values codified to scale engineering team while maintaining how they work together. Values are descriptive not aspirational—team "shipped" them believing they already fully embodied them, so values can be used as yardstick for decisions and guide for growth (not forcing function to change). Implicit in each value is a tradeoff—something given up. Generic values like "write good code" do no good because nobody would espouse the opposite. Four core values: (1) Communicate early and often - don't wait until code review to share direction, solving together better than independently, assume best intentions when receiving feedback. Figma is collaboration tool so collaboration-first attitude reflected in how build software. Avoid cloistered genius archetype—team has huge depth/breadth of knowledge, don't want to throw that expertise away. Work not done in vacuum—share design docs/product specs/architecture drawings (in Figma), vet ideas early, spot issues before investing too much time. Normalize enthusiastic sharing of works-in-progress, makes easier to ask for help, creates opportunities for organic teaching/learning. Global maximum comes from ensuring communication happens every step of way (though heads-down approach could work for some projects/engineers). Not dogmatic—sometimes code is easiest way to communicate, quick bug fixes don't need multiple rounds of communication. Receptiveness to input essential—sharing early minimizes cost of shifting direction. Tradeoff: risk of slowed decision-making due to many voices, spend cycles iterating on communication ensuring every voice heard. (2) Lift your team - help others grow, strive to make people feel better not worse, strive to create inclusive culture supporting diverse opinions, be solution oriented. Nuanced wording—not "lift your company" (engineering is long process that must be sustainable, asking team to think of company before themselves can lead to burnout). About fellow engineers—making sure trying not only to be successful yourself but lifting people around you. Means constant learning/mentorship/growth (weekly tech talks, formal onboarding mentorship, encouragement to learn new skills). Governs interactions on basic level—thoughtful feedback delivery (focus on ideas not people, feedback that insults/belittles/talks down not effective), receptiveness to feedback (take ideas seriously no matter who they come from, ensure equal opportunity to participate). Institutional investment in inclusion required (not just individual commitment)—company-wide bias trainings, systemic adoption of learnings, recurring reading group on identity/inclusion/psychological safety, DE&I sub-committee. Solution-oriented retrospectives—remove finger-pointing from picture, talk about problem only in terms of solutions (how fix going forward, how prevent happening again), drive effective learning without making people feel worse. Tradeoff: must constantly work to ensure not becoming conflict-averse (could lead to group afraid to disagree), but intended to encourage thoughtful/respectful/positive relationships whether agreeing or disagreeing. (3) Craftsmanship - when solving problem do so sustainably, always strive to improve process and learn from missteps. Figma is tool people use to get work done, critical part of design process at thousands of companies, responsibility—any bug/outage may stand in way of user getting job done, want to live up to trust users put in us. About thoughtfulness and care—be deliberate about what build and how maintainable/extendable in future. Solution requiring revisiting in month (not scaling, ton of bugs, doesn't support use cases) not useful and generates pain for users. Learn from past mistakes—retrospectives for every project, constantly look for opportunities to improve (even from smooth projects), identify and consciously propagate things that went well. Not perfectionists—some projects like beta versions can be "sustainable" with clear imperfection as long as doesn't get in way of learning, endless polish as unsustainable as none, but pushes to plan thoughtfully and learn from mistakes. Tradeoff: sometimes day-to-day speed (teams can emphasize moving fast over stable/bug-free), but given role Figma plays in users' lives worth it to hold high quality bar, and in long run being thoughtful often reduces complexity of ongoing development. (4) Prioritize impact - can only solve so many problems at once so pick battles, things built with shelf-life in mind and that's ok. Design tooling will never be "solved"—space of interesting problems gigantic, small team competing with companies orders of magnitude larger. What do first? Focus on things that matter most to users (current and future) above all else. Rigorous specificity—how much will feature matter to users and how many? If think past users of today to where want product to grow tomorrow/next month/next year, will those users' needs be met? Rely on concrete data (number of users hitting bug/requesting feature) and qualitative questions (impact on user experience). No bandwidth to spare on projects that aren't most important. Informs how approach projects too—craftsmanship reflects drive to be thoughtful/sustainable, but prioritizing impact ensures don't go too far (don't over-engineer in name of sustainability). Solution lasting year built in week often better than solution lasting three years built in month (example: multiplayer feature rebuilt after year and half using more scalable tech stack—thoughtfully postponing allowed focus on other features and wait to see how necessary that work truly was). Tradeoff: sometimes must pass over more out there/exciting projects (frustrating, every engineer has half-dozen project ideas in back pockets), but value lets explicitly admit most exciting projects aren't most important right now and gives framework to decide when moonshot worth tackling. How values work together: descriptive not aspirational (yardstick for decisions, guide for growth), explicit tradeoffs (makes meaningful), collaboration-first (reflects Figma being collaboration tool), people-focused (lift your team about fellow engineers not company), balance craftsmanship and impact (ensure don't over-engineer), inclusive and solution-oriented, continuous improvement. Key takeaways: (1) Values descriptive not aspirational, (2) Explicit tradeoffs make values meaningful, (3) Communicate early and often (solve together better), (4) Tradeoff: slower decision-making, (5) Lift your team not company (avoid burnout), (6) Thoughtful feedback delivery (ideas not people), (7) Solution-oriented not finger-pointing, (8) Institutional investment in inclusion, (9) Tradeoff: conflict-averse risk, (10) Craftsmanship thoughtful and sustainable, (11) Tradeoff: sometimes day-to-day speed, (12) Prioritize impact with rigorous specificity, (13) Balance craftsmanship and impact (don't over-engineer), (14) Tradeoff: exciting projects wait, (15) Values are starting point not end (roll into interview/onboarding, may keep iterating).

- **Author:** Whitney Sorenson (He/Him)
- **URL:** https://product.hubspot.com/blog/hubspots-engineering-values
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Engineering values, product and engineering culture, speed and scale, customer obsession, AI-first, unified infrastructure, small teams, technical leadership, developer efficiency, throughput over predictability
- **Key Insight:** Values that drive product and engineering teams at HubSpot, organized around what it means to work as engineers and as a product and engineering organization. Focus on speed, scale, customer obsession, and building great teams. Two main sections: (1) As engineers - 9 values: (a) All in on AI from developer tooling to product future, (b) Build software globally distributed at massive scale (hundreds of thousands or millions of people), (c) Invest in unified infrastructure (easy to get started or jump into systems don't directly own, build best in class tooling, most builds through existing stack, focus more on solving customer problems), (d) Favor starting small and learning quickly by shipping (ideation to product in hours or days not weeks, pragmatic about documentation and design practices supporting speed), (e) On-call culture (take ownership of what build, high bar for quality/reliability, sometimes ship bugs but fix quickly), (f) Build with small teams of 3-4 people (clear ownership, focus, move fast), (g) Tech Leads and Engineering Leads are engineers first managers second (hands on with impactful technical work, delegate by default to create strong peer group taking ownership of team responsibilities), (h) Only hire and promote technical engineering leaders (prioritize solving for customer over perfect processes/planning/programs), (i) Invest in developer efficiency (measure developer productivity to improve way work and build great team, small PRs, fast reviews, collaborative teams win). (2) As product and engineering organization - 9 values: (a) Want to win (unique as large fast growing business, ambitious never satisfied, want outsized gains, you'll be pushed sometimes), (b) Work hard and believe in work flexibility and ability to unplug (balance), (c) Build easy fast unified product (help SMBs scale through powerful consumer grade experiences), (d) Obsess over customers (everything should have customer lens), (e) Move fast and take calculated risks (decisions don't require 100% consensus or 100% data, intuition and ownership count for lot), (f) Value throughput over predictability (processes and planning only need to be good enough, low tolerance for bureaucracy), (g) Building great team (help and support each other through questions/challenges/growth, being part of team is part of reason show up each day, build psychologically safe teams, don't tolerate jerks), (h) Want you to grow and own your growth (manager can coach and align opportunities but you in driver's seat), (i) Want to hear your feedback (don't pretend to be perfect or have everything figured out, constantly trying to improve and evolve, you can help shape better future for team and customers). How values work together: speed and scale (start small ship fast, move fast, throughput over predictability), customer obsession (obsess over customers, everything has customer lens, leaders prioritize solving for customer), ownership and responsibility (on-call culture, own what build, own your growth, take calculated risks), practical over perfect (good enough processes, pragmatic documentation/design, sometimes ship bugs but fix quickly), small teams technical leaders (3-4 person teams, technical leaders engineers first, delegate by default), developer efficiency (unified infrastructure, measure productivity, small PRs fast reviews), great teams (psychologically safe, don't tolerate jerks, help and support, own your growth), AI-first and unified infrastructure (all in on AI, unified infrastructure), ambitious but balanced (want to win work hard but flexibility and ability to unplug). Key takeaways: (1) AI-first approach, (2) Massive scale mindset, (3) Unified infrastructure, (4) Start small ship fast (hours/days not weeks), (5) Pragmatic practices, (6) On-call and ownership, (7) Small teams (3-4 people), (8) Technical leaders first (engineers first managers second), (9) Only technical leaders, (10) Developer efficiency, (11) Want to win (ambitious never satisfied), (12) Work hard but flexible, (13) Customer obsession, (14) Move fast take calculated risks, (15) Throughput over predictability, (16) Build great teams, (17) Own your growth, (18) Open to feedback.

### Shields Down

- **Source:** Rands in Repose (randsinrepose.com)
- **Author:** Michael Lopp (Rands)
- **URL:** https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Employee retention, resignation psychology, leadership, team management, values violations, employee engagement, retention strategies
- **Key Insight:** The moment of resignation happens long before someone says "I'm resigning." It happens the instant they let a glimpse of a potential different future into their mind—their "shields" drop. Understanding when shields drop is critical for leaders who want to retain their best people. Key framework: (1) Resignations happen in a moment (not when declared, but when considering alternative), (2) Shields drop when someone lets potential different future into mind (seems unconsidered off-the-cuff thought but opens possibilities that didn't exist moment before), (3) Complex instant mental math precedes shields-down (when asked to lower shields, immediately parse and evaluate: Am I happy? Do I like manager/team? Is project fulfilling? Am I learning/respected/growing? Fairly compensated? Company/team going anywhere? Believe in vision? Trust leaders?), (4) Each human has different prioritized subset (growth paramount for some, truth for others), (5) Final question: What has happened recently or in past that either supports or detracts from what I value? (answer determines whether shields stay up or go down), (6) When someone resigns, ask two questions: Why are they leaving? (rehearsed answers) and When did their shields go down? (real insight), (7) Shields drop when presented with opportunity and they quickly evaluate rubric and make instant call: Is this job meeting my bar?, (8) "When did you start looking?" reveals real moment, (9) Happy people don't leave jobs they love (if leaving, shields dropped), (10) Leader's responsibility: Something nudged them at critical moment (basic values violation that dug in, stuck, festered), (11) Examples of shield drops: project cancellation rumor (wasn't true but too late), promotion rumor via grapevine (got promotion but too late), dismissive answer at All Hands (signal in gossip), (12) Not just boredom (major contributor but list of contributing factors immense), (13) Cost is exponential (departure cost always exponentially higher than minor situation that caused it), (14) Complex problem (strategies to prevent shields dropping as numerous as reasons they drop, even weekly 1:1s with substance don't always catch it), (15) Every moment matters (every moment as leader is opportunity to strengthen or weaken shields). Real examples: "I've been here three years looking for change" → two months ago told project likely canceled (wasn't), "No idea when I'll be tech lead" → heard via grapevine not being promoted (got promotion too late), "Don't believe senior leadership" → blew off question at All Hands with terse answer (forgot signal in gossip). Key insights: The moment of resignation happens long before declaration, shields drop when considering alternative, instant mental math evaluates current job against rubric, values violations (major or minor at wrong time) cause shields to drop, cost of departure exponentially higher than situation that caused it, every moment as leader is opportunity to strengthen or weaken shields, happy people don't leave jobs they love, leader's responsibility when someone leaves (screwed up somehow), strategies to prevent are complex (numerous as reasons they drop), ask "when did you start looking?" to find real moment.

### "Sharing Interesting Stuff" Management Tool

- **Source:** Shipup Blog (Medium)
- **Author:** Florian Fesseler (VP Engineering @ Shipup)
- **URL:** https://medium.com/shipup-blog/sharing-interesting-stuff-a-simple-yet-powerful-management-tool-771d3c2b39b7
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Management practices, 1:1 meetings, relationship building, knowledge sharing, team learning, remote work, coaching, learning culture
- **Key Insight:** A practice for deepening manager–direct report relationships through structured knowledge sharing. The idea: direct report sends resource (blog post, book chapter, video, podcast) and related questions a few days before meeting, discuss opinions and answer questions, then alternate roles next session. Context: After joining as VP Engineering, felt need to create strong relationships and get to know people on deeper level (way we think, what we value, experiences) beyond regular 1:1s, but wanted to accelerate learnings. Framing: Shouldn't cost too much time, remain informal (open discussion, no judgment, no objectives), get to know each other on deeper level. Format: Frequency - bi-weekly alternating roles each session, Duration - 30 minutes no more, Location - office or remote (both work well, good opportunity for remote), Preparation - resource sent at least few days before to have time to think (store resource link and questions on Notion page), Any topic you find interesting. Partially influenced by previous experiment during lockdown inspired by learning practice session from Philippe Bourgau. Examples: (1) Manager → Report: Code Review Pyramid article with questions about model usefulness, what to add to pyramid, what don't check enough. (2) Report → Manager: Scaling Up Sustainable Engineering Processes article with questions about avoiding "too much too soon" feeling, whether processes could have benefited from testing phase. Benefits after few dozen sessions: (1) Sharing related experiences - engineering leader brings experience to company, past experiences help improve or avoid mistakes, interesting to discuss positive/negative sides. (2) Forcing yourself to know more about topic - advantage of sharing in advance is time to read and think, sometimes realize mind not as clear as thought, put ideas in order and dig deeper to come up with clear opinion, feeling of needing to master subject (like teaching or preparing for interview). (3) Bringing topics that wouldn't surface otherwise - usually 1:1 topics are "fresh" ones (last sprint, production issues, recent victories), sharing sessions bring discussions that wouldn't happen because no recent events touched that topic, way to broaden discussions and make them happen earlier rather than waiting for them to appear. (4) Finding out what topics resonate with everyone - alternating roles reinforces informal side putting hierarchical relationship aside, also helps find what topics particularly resonate (which lead to powerful conversations vs. "interesting but not too much to say"), hard to know what caught team's eyes without this practice. (5) Taking pulse of given topic - sometimes practices easy in new environment that were hard before, or quick wins were actually difficult, used practice to take pulse of process improvement/practice/principle/idea that wouldn't be easy to bring, informal discussion with open questions helps evaluate feelings, see precautions to take, or plant seed and see how it grows. (6) Finding coaching opportunities - discussions can lead to coaching opportunity when question doesn't have clear answer or no experience, ad-hoc coaching session focusing on topic. (7) Reinforcing culture of learning & sharing - resources come from reading habits, learning & sharing is pillar of engineering culture (everyone has allocated time), practice reinforces that culture. (8) Works particularly well in remote context - doesn't require specific tooling, basically discussion, well-suited for remote (like virtual water cooler for informal discussions and relationship building). After few dozen sessions value still high - fact that content shared in advance, people prepared, actively try to replan sessions (rather than canceling) says a lot, sessions always enjoyable, sense of serendipity happening. Practice can be done between any level of employee, not just manager–report. Key takeaways: (1) Simple format (send resource + questions, discuss, alternate), (2) Format details (bi-weekly alternating, 30 min, office/remote, few days advance, any topic), (3) Initial objective (deeper relationships, accelerate learnings), (4) Framing (not too much time, informal, open discussion), (5) Eight benefits, (6) Alternating roles (informal, find what resonates), (7) Storage (Notion page), (8) Preparation matters, (9) Indicators of value (replan not cancel, enjoyable, serendipity), (10) Scalable (any level), (11) Cultural reinforcement (learning & sharing), (12) Remote-friendly.

### Good Morning Learning

- **Source:** Philippe Bourgau's XP Coaching Blog (philippe.bourgau.net)
- **Author:** Philippe Bourgau (Software Development Coach)
- **URL:** https://philippe.bourgau.net/growth-mindset-coaching-turn-remote-work-commutes-into-team-learning/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Daily learning sessions, growth mindset, compound learning, remote work, team learning, knowledge sharing, active recall, coaching, habit formation
- **Key Insight:** A daily 30-minute learning session format: 20 minutes studying, 10 minutes sharing. Use remote work commutes as an opportunity to build compound learning habits and coach growth mindset. The format: Every day, study during 20 minutes, share during 10 minutes, invite a guest, split the group when too large. Story: Learning addict demoralized by infinite things to learn, keeping skills up to date crucial for software industry. Inspiration from Woody Zuill's mob programming training - "At Hunters, we started every day with 1 hour of learning." When lockdown hit, commute time went from 50 minutes to 50 seconds - perfect occasion to give daily learning a try. Tech agile coach colleagues started meeting every morning for 30 minutes (20 minutes studying, 10 minutes sharing). Some read books, others looked at articles, others experimented. Week in, everyone got hooked. Part-time coaches started inviting teammates, group grew too large, had to fork and start spin-offs in different teams. Practice has been growing since then. Coaching growth mindset: When coaching team, installing growth mindset is main goal. Good Morning Learning coaches growth mindset in 2 ways: (1) Continuous learning - after few weeks coachees see they can now do things they used not to, with time increases confidence in abilities to overcome challenges, (2) Hacking remote work commutes into learning shows how to embrace change (not only adapt to disrupting constraints but get even better). Using remote work commute to setup compound learning habit is antifragile move. Compound learning: Richard W. Hamming quote from "You and Your Research" - "Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of same ability, one who works ten percent more will more than twice outproduce the other. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime." Compound learning is extra-ordinary (magical) - over long term makes us more productive and keeps bosses happy, higher productivity means more sustainable pace, more sustainable pace is opportunity to have more time to enjoy life. Like compound interests, spending 30 minutes daily learning trains you to learn faster and internalizes knowledge that enables grasping more advanced topics. Coach learns too. How to set it up: (1) Open calendar app, (2) Schedule 30 minutes daily appointment at time you used to commute, (3) Invite coachees and guest. During session: (1) Everyone forks off to study something for 20 minutes, (2) Everyone joins back group after 20 minutes and shares what learned. If too much to share in 10 minutes, split session into 2, every group now has to invite guest. Good Morning Learning is corporate hack - guerrilla coaches with no formal authority can use commute time (no one can justify you should be cranking out features at time you used to commute). Why it works: (1) It's motivating - Daniel Pink's Drive says Mastery is crucial element to intrinsic motivation, growing mastery on your topic before anything else makes every day feel more valuable, starting every work day by studying and growing mastery on topic you care about builds intrinsic motivation. (2) Social pressure - having to share what you learn with teammates adds dash of social pressure, nudges us into using 20 minutes of learning efficiently. (3) Active recall - essential principle for efficient learning (see MOOC Learning how to learn), reformulating for colleagues forces you to organize new knowledge, in end you remember better. (4) Viral hack - rule of inviting someone from another team to session is viral hack, people who tried Good Morning Learning love it and want to continue, most of time they replicate it in their teams when group grows and splits. Win-win strategy: Free in current WorkFromHome context (stick to remote work commutes time and you're safe), sets up compounding learning habit for you and coachees, motivating way to coach growth-mindset. Key takeaways: (1) Format (every day, 20 min study, 10 min share, invite guest, split when large), (2) Opportunity (remote work commutes perfect for daily learning), (3) Coaching growth mindset (continuous learning, embracing change), (4) Compound learning (knowledge and productivity like compound interest), (5) Simple setup (schedule at commute time, invite coachees and guest), (6) Corporate hack (guerrilla coaches can use commute time), (7) Why it works (motivating, social pressure, active recall, viral hack), (8) Growth and replication (spreads organically when groups split), (9) Win-win strategy (free, compound learning, growth mindset), (10) Coach learns too.

### Management Training for Startups

- **Source:** First Round Review (review.firstround.com)
- **Author:** Featuring Melissa and Johnathan Nightingale (co-founders of Raw Signal Group)
- **URL:** https://review.firstround.com/your-startups-management-training-probably-sucks-heres-how-to-make-it-better/
- **Date:** Not specified
- **Key Concepts:** Management training, leadership development, startup scaling, manager development, training programs, organizational development, first-time managers
- **Key Insight:** Why management training matters for startups (despite "hire smart people and get out of their way" quote), when to start (milestones at 40, 70, 120-150, 350 person orgs), 7 common mistakes to avoid (building in-house, only training new managers, siloing by department, minimum viable training, CEOs joining, personality assessments as primary tool, role-playing), and 4 essential modules every manager training should include (goal setting, talent management, employee lifecycle and hiring, leadership & culture development). The problem: Management often falls to back burner at early-stage companies, but many cracks that emerge as startups scale trace back to missing managerial cornerstones - alignment issues, siloing, conflicts between teams, duplicate work. "There are a lot of people who have been given power in an organization, but no training on how to wield that power." Power is weird - being a peer then becoming someone's boss, giving feedback to friend vs. someone you can fire. When to start: Key phrases indicate it's time ("We've doubled in size, but we haven't doubled our output"). Milestones: 40-person (things get harder), 70-person (silos creep up), 120-150 (fractured culture), 350 (more bought in). Warning: "When you're a really small startup, co-founder drama is the likely company-killer. But as your org gets larger, the thing that often tanks the company is waiting too long to bring on competent management." 7 mistakes: (1) Building in-house (startups use someone else's payment provider/CRM, shouldn't build training either, HR presentations get ignored by engineering/sales leaders), (2) Only training new managers (leaves mid-senior/exec under-equipped, new managers bring techniques unfamiliar to bosses, mixed cohorts outperform), (3) Siloing by department (cross-functional leaders talk past each other, training should bolster relationships, not create silos), (4) Minimum viable training/lunch-and-learn (signals org doesn't value management, doesn't provide room for why, Raw Signal works across 6 weeks weekly basis), (5) CEOs joining in (changes dynamic, alters vibe, need safe space for vulnerability), (6) Personality assessments as primary tool (DISC, Myers-Briggs, Strengths Finder, Enneagrams - make others into shallow caricatures, force-fit oversimplifies), (7) Role-playing (awkward, falsified constructs hard to apply, better to create safe space for actual struggles). 4 essential modules: (1) Goal setting - root of management is make team more effective through thoughtful support of creativity and high-trust environment, OKRs/OPSPs/Rocks not about framework but translating strategic vision, build predictive ability (can you stare down next quarter and evaluate if resourced appropriately), emphasize cross-functional work (interesting work at intersection of teams), "The people who will screw you over typically don't work in your department - they don't have same frameworks in their head." (2) Talent management - 1:1s (how often are you surprised? gauge effectiveness), feedback (understand what feedback trying to do, self-assess if useful), DEI needs seat at table (inclusion layer, power and marginalization), firing (recoverable under-performance, PIP graduation, how to know when time, work with HR/Legal). (3) Employee lifecycle and hiring - recruiting takes time, train on working with recruiting counterpart, understand job rec (seniority, comparables, job description), compensation system (when someone asks for raise). (4) Leadership & culture development - values on wall (what do they mean, do we all think same thing, are they real, guidepost for behavior), operationalize culture, comes last (need management skills and shared accountability first), "Are you building the culture we want? Do values on wall reflect real values or different behaviors get promoted?" Training principles: Ground in past experience as direct report (what it felt like to not have power, boss changing mind, boss unavailable), start from philosophical place (why are you here, what do we pay managers to do), multi-week (6 weeks, weekly meetings), mixed cohorts (range of seniority, culturally relevant), cross-functional (bolster relationships), safe space (confidentiality, facilitators go first with vulnerability), credibility (trainers come from doing the work, not just training). Management is totally different role - work expected, problems solving, calendar all different. Need to communicate explicitly when promoting: "This is different role, things that made you successful still relevant, but things that will make you successful are different, learnable but will take work." Key takeaways: (1) Management matters despite quote, (2) Problems stem from under-equipped teams, (3) When to start (milestones), (4) Warning signs, (5) 7 mistakes to avoid, (6) 4 essential modules, (7) Training principles, (8) Management is different role, (9) Power dynamics matter, (10) Mixed cohorts outperform.

### The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience

- **Source:** Elided Branches (elidedbranches.com)
- **Author:** Camille Fournier (CTO, author, member of Apache ZooKeeper community)
- **URL:** https://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/06/the-virtues-of-laziness-and-impatience.html
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Leadership virtues, management practices, work-life balance, burnout prevention, focus, efficiency, process improvement, team scaling
- **Key Insight:** Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris as virtues for engineers (from Larry Wall's "Programming Perl") sustain into leadership. Channeling these traits as advantages: impatience and laziness are wonderful when directed at processes and decisions, not people. As leaders grow, people look to them for behavioral guidance. What to teach: how to focus. Two areas to practice showing: figuring out what's important, and going home. Problem: Watching people waste energy approaching problems with brute force and spending time rather than thought, any culture encouraging excessive hours all the time is doing just that. Value of automation is to make your job easier - engineers automate to focus on fun stuff (uses most of your brain), which you can't do for hours and hours day after day. Be impatient to figure out what's important - as leader, when you see something inefficient, ask: Why does this feel inefficient? What is the value? Can we deliver that value faster? Can we strip down this project into something simpler? Problem with "faster" question: Often managers explicitly or implicitly want to know if team can work harder or longer hours to deliver in fewer days. This is why show value of laziness - "faster" is not about "same number of hours but fewer total days," it's about "same value to company in less total time." If team works 60 hours in week to deliver something that would've taken week and a half, they haven't worked faster, they've just given company more free time. Going home: Go home! Stop emailing at all hours of night and weekend! Forcing yourself to disengage essential for mental health. Burnout real problem in American workforce, almost everyone who worked sustained excess hours has experienced it to some degree - terrible for individuals, families, teams. But not just about preventing your own burnout, it's about preventing team's burnout. When you work later than everyone else, send emails at all hours, even if you don't expect team to respond, they see you doing it and think it's important. That overwork makes them less effective, especially at detailed knowledge work engineers need to perform. Practical tips for new managers: When newish manager and haven't figured out tricks to do job effectively, might need to work more hours for little while - that's ok. But figure out way to work those hours without encouraging team to do so or making them feel obligated to be on your schedule. Queue up weekend and overnight emails for next work day. Put chat status as "away" in off hours. Take vacation and don't answer email during that time. Constantly ask yourself same questions you ask team: Can I do this faster? Do I need to be doing this at all? What is the value I'm providing with this work? The virtuous cycle: Laziness and impatience. We focus so we can go home, and we encourage going home because it forces us to constantly focus. This is how great teams scale. Key takeaways: (1) Laziness, Impatience, Hubris as virtues (from Larry Wall), (2) Applied to processes not people, (3) Two areas to practice (figuring out what's important, going home), (4) Be impatient to figure out what's important, (5) "Faster" doesn't mean more hours (same value in less total time), (6) Go home (stop emailing at all hours), (7) Prevent team burnout, (8) Practical tips (queue emails, set away status, take vacation, ask yourself same questions), (9) Automation to make job easier, (10) Virtuous cycle (focus so we can go home, going home forces focus, how great teams scale).

### Lazy Leadership

- **Source:** The Flow Blog (Medium)
- **Author:** Andrew Wilkinson (founder of MetaLab, Flow, and Pixel Union)
- **URL:** https://medium.com/flow/lazy-leadership-8ba19e34f959
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Delegation, entrepreneurship, leadership style, building systems, working ON vs IN business, company culture, process, metrics, scaling
- **Key Insight:** Lazy Leadership isn't about being lazy—it's about spending time on what matters and what you're good at, then leaving everything else to your team. Entrepreneurship is really just a fancy word for delegation—continuous process of removing yourself from equation step-by-step. Build a machine (inspired by Ray Dalio's Principles)—think of business as machine you engineer to produce outcomes you want. Work ON your business instead of IN it. Focus on culture, process, and results. The paradox: On paper, terrible CEO (avoids office, rarely starts before noon), but built companies with 200+ employees. So-called laziness is actually huge advantage. The lazy way: First cut out middle man (boss), hire someone to do work while you handle high level stuff, over time hire more people, then managers, then executives, finally can hire CEO to run whole company while you sit on board—you can literally delegate running whole company. The delegation barrier: Some entrepreneurs never break through—try hiring, when person doesn't behave exactly like them, jump in and take over, build muscle memory, convince themselves only they can do things properly. "If your business depends on you, you don't own a business, you have a job." Test: What if you went on vacation for six months? If would fall apart, you've made yourself more important than needed, working IN business instead of ON it. Building machine: Henry Ford didn't build cars, he built factories. Great leader's job is build machine that produces product, not do work itself. Inspired by Ray Dalio (Bridgewater Associates, $150B portfolio, 30-year track record) — secret to success is thinking about business as machine you engineer. Determine result you want, design machine that will produce it, figure out what people you need. If part of machine, think about strengths and weaknesses, replace yourself with someone better suited if necessary. Example: Hates traveling, was limiting factor, swapped others into roles requiring travel, business grew because no longer limiting factor. The MetaLab machine: Framework—requires happy former clients, demand from new clients, talented designers and developers. Machine composed of: HR, Operations, Client Relations, Business Development, Finance. First few years wore most hats (some good at, some terrible at), company chaotic and inefficient. Today only spend time on things good at and nobody else can do—learning about clients and making sure meeting their needs (need to understand what clients want to build machine). Aside from that, could get sideswiped by semi tomorrow and trains would keep running. Hired super talented people better than him at each key role, frees up to focus on important stuff: culture, process, results. Where to focus: (1) Reinforcing culture—spend lot of time thinking about culture and maintaining it as company grows. Culture isn't beer taps or swag, it's framework for decision making. When build framework of values, most questions answerable without your involvement. MetaLab values: Job that doesn't feel like job (freedom and autonomy), focus on craftsmanship (is this best we can do, are we proud), no jargon or buzzwords, no assholes allowed, people over profits, be honest not perfect. (2) Building process—used to hate process (thought kills morale), learned simple unintrusive process key. Creative work doesn't mean no recipe—like bakery hiring bakers and saying "make pies" without recipe, every pie different. Today simple: give team 5-10 questions to answer during each phase before moving to next. Example kick-off questions: What problem is client trying to solve? How does product solve problem? Who is target customer? How different from other products? What do they stand for? What pain points are existing users experiencing? What are users loving? In one sentence, how will we know we've been successful? Like core values, knowing answers gives team framework to answer most important questions. (3) Tracking results—in early days, knew going well if more money at end of month than beginning. Once scale up, bank balance doesn't tell you much. Work quality can decline, morale bad, clients unhappy, staff without work—got pulled into weeds, wasn't watching results. 10 metrics to track weekly: Team Utilization, 30/60/90 Day Team Utilization, Client Net Promoter Score, Team Net Promoter Score, New Business Pipeline, Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Collection Effectiveness, Profit Margin. If metric slipping, know need to work on improving process. Take a step back: Still think about work all the time, still have lot to do, still get stressed and work crazy hours. Difference is working ON business instead of IN it, focusing on things good at while let people good in weak spots do rest. Instead of making pies, writing recipes. Something amazing: When realize don't have to make all pies, realize difference between Fortune 500 and small business isn't all that huge—can design machine, target result, plug in right people, tweak until spits out result you want. Lazy Leadership isn't really about being lazy—it's about spending time on what matters and what you're good at, leaving everything else to team. Thinking of business as machine you design and optimize, instead of becoming worn out cog within. Key takeaways: (1) Lazy Leadership paradox, (2) Entrepreneurship is delegation, (3) The delegation barrier, (4) Test (vacation for six months), (5) Build a machine, (6) Replace yourself, (7) Only spend time on what you're good at and nobody else can do, (8) Three areas to focus (culture, process, results), (9) MetaLab's core values, (10) The difference (ON vs IN), (11) Lazy Leadership isn't about being lazy.

### The Non-Linear Problem of 90% Utilization

- **Source:** A Smart Bear (longform.asmartbear.com)
- **Author:** Jason Cohen
- **URL:** https://longform.asmartbear.com/utilization/
- **Date:** 2025
- **Key Concepts:** Team utilization, capacity management, productivity, context-switching, interruptions, burnout, system resilience, cascading failures
- **Key Insight:** Is everyone working very hard, all the time, and yet accomplishing 1/10th of what it seems they should? 90% utilization is causing more failure than you realize—not just in burn-out, but in productivity and output. Using server utilization analogy: Server at 50% capacity handles spikes gracefully. Server at 90% makes system brittle—normal variations cause failures. Multi-server problem: Even with multiple servers at 70% capacity, when one fails, others must absorb load (105% capacity), causing cascading failures. This isn't really about servers; it's about you and your teams. "Busy" life diminishes productivity. Whole team is hectic yet bringing itself to a crawl. We all have capacity—measured in hours, energy, or focused attention. Life-requests: emails, tickets, leads, co-workers, friends, families. 90% utilization causes failure—not just burn-out, but productivity and output suffer. Twin enemies of productivity: Frequent context-switching and interruption. Work drags out because constantly interrupted. Some work abandoned. Cascading failures: When everyone operates at 90%, inevitable hiccup from one person causes ripple effect that hurts others. Over-capacity people ripple problem to others—cascade like chain reaction. The key word: inevitable. People get sick, die, leave, change, run errands, do unplanned work. True emergencies arise. Can't "architect out" of universe—need to assume variation and interruption. Build resilient systems: Design personal and team work-style to be resilient to variation. Assume interruptions will happen. The ideal: Most of time in safe zone, occasional surges into high gear for short period of time and for good cause (product launch bug fixes, clear-and-present danger rally, fun surges like Hack-a-Thon). The trap: Over-utilization creates needless turmoil and lower productivity, not competitive advantage through higher productivity. Don't fall into the trap—don't let yourself or your team operate at 90% utilization. Key takeaways: (1) Server analogy (50% handles spikes, 90% brittle), (2) Multi-server problem (70% each, one fails = 105% on others), (3) About you and teams (busy = crawl), (4) We all have capacity, (5) 90% causes failure, (6) Twin enemies (context-switching, interruption), (7) Cascading failures, (8) Inevitable interruptions, (9) Build resilient systems, (10) The ideal (safe zone with occasional surges), (11) The trap, (12) Don't fall into trap.

### Great Developers Are Raised, Not Hired

- **Source:** sizovs.net
- **Author:** Eduard Sizov
- **URL:** https://sizovs.net/mentoring/
- **Date:** Not specified
- **Key Concepts:** Mentoring, hiring strategy, talent development, team building, impostor syndrome, growth mindset, raw diamonds, mentoring capacity, pair programming, career development
- **Key Insight:** A counterintuitive approach to hiring: Instead of searching for the "best talent" that may not exist, companies should focus on building mentoring capacity and raising developers. Hire for attitude, teach technical skills. Core problem: Every company is looking for "best talent" (ideal candidate with all technical skills, culture fit, performs with little supervision), but best developers hired were far from ideal - lacked technical skills, didn't know testing/agile, didn't believe in themselves, had impostor syndrome, didn't sound convincing in interviews. Companies create complicated multi-step interview processes that filter out "not good enough" candidates, rarely give opportunity to candidates spoiled by shitty companies/bad influence, forget some candidates weren't lucky enough to meet inspiring mentor or work in supportive team - "broken toys" not welcome. We prefer hiring self-confident rockstars with solid track record because we fail to create environments where people can grow professionally, develop good habits, become rockstars. Skilled developers don't have time for mentoring (busy coding/architecture), mentoring not part of hiring/delivery processes. Companies spend millions on TA departments, recruiters, promo websites/videos struggling to find best talent, but have talent search problem because searching for best engineers instead of raising them - "everyone is fishing but not much fish left, recruiting more fishers doesn't help, the pond is empty." Solution: Build mentoring capacity - experienced developers should grow less experienced colleagues through pair programming, continuous feedback, career advice, suggest books/blogs/videos, encourage meetups/conferences/workshops. Mentoring requires significant time commitment and excellent communication skills, but is best way to get followers and boost authority/reputation - "your mentees are your fan club" (will support and promote you for rest of life). By building mentoring capacity, can hire newcomers, broken toys, impostors and turn them into loyal high-quality workforce. Shifting focus from assessing to mentoring simplifies interviewing process - instead of trying to predict future performance through tough questions and "nine circles of hell," hire candidates with growth mindset and grow them. Raw diamond analogy: Companies look for polished diamonds and create hiring processes that throw raw diamonds in trash bin. Instead, learn to polish them - create environments where people with eagerness and capacity to learn can become great developers. Four ways: (1) Take money/energy/time spent on recruiting and invest in teaching best developers mentoring skills, give time for mentoring and free them from routine tasks, (2) Adjust interview process and give chance to candidates not good enough yet but eager to learn with growth mindset (raw diamonds), (3) Relax hard requirements in job ads to avoid filtering out impostors (remember most women apply only where they completely fit requirements), (4) Large companies consider creating bootcamp for complete beginners. Core principle: Escape crazy hiring race by creating environment where experienced developers mentor less experienced developers. "Hire for attitude, and teach technical skills. Great developers are raised, not hired." Be the company that says "we are ~~hiring~~ mentoring." Key takeaways: (1) Best developers hired were far from ideal candidates, (2) Companies filter out broken toys, (3) We fail to create environments where people grow, (4) The pond is empty (everyone fishing, not much fish), (5) Build mentoring capacity, (6) Mentoring benefits mentors too (authority, reputation, fan club), (7) Raw diamonds analogy (polish instead of throwing away), (8) Shift from assessing to mentoring (simplify interviewing), (9) Four ways to build mentoring culture, (10) Hire for attitude, teach technical skills.
